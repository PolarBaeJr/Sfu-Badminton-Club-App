# Online dump of prod Supabase Postgres into the dev Supabase Postgres,
# no prod downtime. pg_dump uses MVCC; concurrent writes during the
# snapshot are tolerated.
#
# Runs entirely through `docker exec`, so the Pi host doesn't need
# postgresql-client installed.
#
# Scope:
#   - public schema (full drop and recreate)  — all app data
#   - auth.users + auth.identities            — keeps player.user_id FKs valid
# Skipped: prod auth sessions / refresh_tokens / etc — staging gets
# fresh sessions.
#
# Two things are deliberately NOT faithful copies of prod afterwards, because a
# faithful copy is the wrong answer for both:
#   - Discord config is staging's own, never prod's (see the capture/scrub pair
#     below) — inheriting prod's would aim the staging bot at the real guild.
#   - $STAGING_ADMIN_EMAILS are re-granted admin on staging, because prod roles
#     leave the owner unable to use the staging admin console at all.
#   - THE MEMBERS ARE SCRUBBED. Names, emails, phones, bios, officer notes,
#     audit diffs and every bearer token are replaced or deleted at the end of
#     the run, because staging is on the public internet and is where untested
#     code gets deployed on purpose. Ids, ratings, matches and row counts are
#     kept, so it stays a realistic rehearsal. See "SCRUB THE MEMBERS" below.
#
# Idempotent. Safe to re-run. Existing dev DB rows in those scopes are wiped,
# and so is anything in dev's public schema that prod does not have — see
# "the drop is explicit" below.

# THERE ARE TWO CHECKOUTS ON THE PI AND THE CRON USES THE ONE YOU DO NOT EXPECT.
#
# ~/ssd/Deploy/badminton            stale. Last commit `b96dc74b`, months behind
#                                   production, on branch fixup/security-and-cleanup,
#                                   with a dirty docker-compose.yml and an
#                                   untracked backup/ directory. Its copy of this
#                                   script is the July version with the dead
#                                   container names. NOTHING RUNS IT.
# ~/ssd/Deploy/badminton-staging    LIVE. Branch deploy/docker-staging, clean.
#                                   This is what the crontab calls, and it is the
#                                   only copy that matters.
#
# Editing this file in the repo changes nothing on the Pi by itself: that is a
# plain checkout and nothing auto-updates it, unlike the player and admin
# images. A change here reaches production behaviour only after this branch is
# merged to deploy/docker-staging AND someone runs `git pull` in
# ~/ssd/Deploy/badminton-staging. Verified 2026-09-22 by reading both.
#
# HISTORY, because the header used to say the opposite. This script did fail
# every night from 7 July 2026 on container names that do not exist
# (`supabase_db_badminton` / `..._dev`). That was fixed and merged to
# deploy/docker-staging, and it has been running successfully since: the live
# copy is dated 27 August and cron.log's last entry is a clean completion. The
# earlier "IT HAS NOT RUN SINCE 7 JULY" banner here was describing the stale
# checkout above, which still has the broken names, and it was wrong about the
# one that runs. It is now copying real production members nightly, which is
# exactly why the scrub at the bottom of this file exists.
#
# So read (1)-(3) below as "what would have happened, measured on throwaway
# clusters", NOT as "what has been happening nightly". In particular the blanket GRANT in
# (2) has not been re-opening `anon`'s access every night for the last six weeks,
# because it has not been reached. Whatever staging drift 00157 cleans up
# predates 7 July.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THREE THINGS THIS SCRIPT USED TO GET WRONG, and TWO GUARDS THE FIXES NEEDED.
# All of it was reproduced on a pair of throwaway Postgres 16 clusters before
# being changed here, because every one of these fails SILENTLY on a database
# nobody watches.
#
# 1. THE DROP IS EXPLICIT NOW, because pg_dump's was not safe.
#    `pg_dump --schema=public --clean` emits a bare `DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS
#    "public";` with no CASCADE. That succeeds only while dev's public schema
#    holds NOTHING that prod does not also have — and dev is the database where
#    migrations are rehearsed, so it is routinely ahead of prod. Staging carries
#    00123's `recompute_player_stats` today; prod does not. With one such object
#    present the DROP fails, and under `-v ON_ERROR_STOP=1` the ENTIRE restore
#    aborts at that line, after auth.users has already been truncated. Measured:
#    psql exits 3 and not a single prod table lands.
#    So the drop is now ours, with CASCADE, before anything else is touched, and
#    the dump is taken WITHOUT `--clean` so there is only one drop in play.
#    Its cascade NOTICEs are logged: they are the list of things dev had and
#    prod does not, which is worth seeing in the morning.
#
#    READ THIS BEFORE RE-ENABLING THE CRON. That list is not debris — on this
#    project it is usually THE MIGRATION YOU ARE CURRENTLY TESTING. A snapshot
#    resets staging to prod, so a migration applied to staging at 22:00 is gone
#    by 04:01. That was always the intent of the tool and it is what `--clean`
#    did too, on any night when it worked at all; what changed is that it now
#    reliably succeeds, so the effect is no longer masked by the abort in (1).
#    While you are rehearsing a migration on staging, either pause this cron or
#    expect to re-apply. The cascade NOTICEs in the log tell you exactly what
#    you will need to put back.
#
# 2. THE PRIVILEGES ARE MIRRORED, not blanket-granted.
#    `--no-acl` restores objects with no privileges at all, so something has to
#    put them back or the staging app gets "permission denied for schema
#    public" on every read. This script used to do that with
#    `GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES/FUNCTIONS ... TO anon, authenticated,
#    service_role` plus a matching ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES. That handed the
#    browser key EVERYTHING, every night:
#      - `purgeable_inactive_players`, the members-queued-for-deletion view, is
#        security_invoker=false so RLS never applies to it. 00064:109 revokes it
#        by name; the blanket line gave it straight back. That is the staging
#        drift 00157 cleans up.
#      - every SECURITY DEFINER function 00126 took away from `anon`, returned.
#        And the ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES line meant functions created by LATER
#        migrations were born anon-executable.
#    scripts/sql/mirror-public-acls.sql now reads prod's catalogue and emits
#    prod's OWN grants. Ablated: the blanket version diverges from prod on 9 of
#    60 privilege checks, all of them `purgeable_inactive_players` or the
#    anon-revoked function; the mirror diverges on 0 of 60.
#
# 3. THE REALTIME PUBLICATION IS PUT BACK.
#    Publication MEMBERSHIP is not in a `--schema=public` dump (grep it: zero
#    hits) and it dies with the tables. `supabase_realtime` therefore came back
#    still existing and completely empty, which is not an error anywhere — it is
#    every live badge and the whole door page quietly never updating again on
#    staging. scripts/sql/mirror-public-publications.sql re-adds prod's
#    membership. REPLICA IDENTITY needs no help; pg_dump does carry that.
#
# 4. THE CASCADE IN (1) IS ITSELF A NEW RISK, so it is gated.
#    The old drop could not cascade; ours can, and CASCADE reaches OUT of the
#    schema. A trigger on auth.users calling a public.handle_new_user(), an
#    extension installed into public, a foreign key from another schema into
#    public.players, a view elsewhere selecting from public, a column typed as a
#    public enum — CASCADE takes every one of them, and `--schema=public`
#    restores none of them. Signup would then write no player row, for ever,
#    with nothing in any log: the exact failure class the rest of this header is
#    about. Grepping the migrations says this repo has no such dependent, but the
#    migrations are not the whole database — Supabase's init ran first, the owner
#    has run SQL by hand, and `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS` is a silent no-op
#    that reveals nothing about where the extension actually landed. So the
#    question is put to the live database every night instead:
#    scripts/sql/check-public-dependents.sql lists anything outside public that
#    depends on it, and any output is fatal BEFORE the drop. Ablated: a planted
#    auth.users trigger names itself and stops the run with dev untouched; the
#    same query returns zero rows once it is removed.
#
# 5. AN EMPTY PRIVILEGE MIRROR IS REFUSED.
#    The generator in (2) returning zero rows still exits 0, which would wipe
#    dev, restore it, apply a file of pure comments, and leave staging with no
#    grants — empty pages rather than an error, since a failed PostgREST read
#    arrives as an empty list. A floor of 20 statements is checked before the
#    drop. Ablated: a generator stubbed to return nothing refuses the run and
#    leaves dev's 64 grants in place. The publication generator gets the same
#    treatment, except that its floor has to be a COMPARISON against prod rather
#    than a threshold: zero blocks is the correct answer for a `FOR ALL TABLES`
#    publication, so a fixed minimum would block such a database every night.

# CAPTURE STAGING'S OWN DISCORD CONFIG.
#
# These four tables live in public, so the drop below takes them — and then
# prod's dump puts PROD'S rows back in their place. That is the part that makes
# this worth code rather than a warning: staging would come up holding prod's
# guild id, prod's role ids, prod's discord_bot_url and prod's service secret,
# i.e. the staging bot aimed at the production Discord server, with the
# credentials to act on it.
#
# What saves it today is only that staging's bot is a separate Discord
# application and is not a member of the prod guild, so its calls 403. That is
# luck, not a safeguard, and it stops being true the moment somebody reuses a
# token.
#
# So: capture staging's own rows here, and after the restore delete whatever
# prod's dump left and put these back. Note the asymmetry that matters —
# "staging had no config" must end as "staging has no config", NEVER as
# "staging inherits prod's". The delete below is therefore unconditional; this
# capture only decides what goes back afterwards.
# psql is asked for -q, and the result is then FILTERED to INSERT lines anyway.
# Both, because -q alone was not enough and the failure was silent for a night:
# without it psql writes the command tag of every statement to stdout, so
# `CREATE TEMP TABLE` and the `DO` block put the literal words "CREATE TABLE"
# and "DO" at the top of the captured file. Replaying that is
# `ERROR: syntax error at or near "DO"` -- psql had already read "CREATE TABLE"
# and "DO" as one unterminated statement -- which under ON_ERROR_STOP + set -e
# killed the whole script AFTER the scrub had deleted prod's rows. Staging woke
# up with no Discord config at all, and the NOTIFY and the retention sweep at
# the end never ran either. The grep is the actual guarantee: it does not depend
# on which psql outputs are considered "informational" by which version.

# Everything above this point has faithfully copied production's membership onto

# written about members, fee records. That is what `pg_dump public` plus
# auth.users gives you, and for two months nobody noticed because the script was
# failing before it got here.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Staging is not a locked room. It is reachable on the
# public internet at badminton.polardev.org, it is deliberately NOT gated on the
# test suite (docs/STAGING.md: staging is where you go to find out whether
# something works, and refusing to deploy a red commit there removes the one
# place it is safe to look at one), and it is the target of every rehearsal. A
# copy of the real membership sitting behind untested code is a risk that buys
# nothing: the original staging seed was fourteen synthetic accounts and it
# covered every state the console has a control for.
#
# So the copy stays, because realistic row counts and real relationships are the
# whole point of a rehearsal, and the PEOPLE are replaced.
#
# WHAT IS PRESERVED, deliberately:
#   - every id, foreign key, rating, match, score, date and count
#   - member_code, role, is_exec, active_flag, membership_type, fee status
#   - the deleted+...@deleted.invalid sentinel on already-purged members, so
#     staging keeps a real example of an anonymised account
#   - $STAGING_ADMIN_EMAILS, untouched, because sign-in on staging is an email
#     code and scrubbing the owner's address locks the owner out of staging
#     entirely. Those are the owner's own addresses, not a member's.
#
# STABLE ACROSS REFRESHES. Every replacement is derived from the row's own id,
# so a member is the same "Jordan Nguyen" tomorrow morning as today. A random
# name per run would make a bug report written against staging unreadable by the
# next day.
#
# Set SCRUB_MEMBER_DATA=0 to skip, for the rare case of reproducing a bug that
