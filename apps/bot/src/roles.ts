// audited the way the app's permission changes are. See docs/design/discord-bot.md §5.
//
// THE THREE MEMBERSHIP ROLES ARE THE DELIBERATE EXCEPTION, and it is an
// exception the club asked for: @Internal, @Alumni and @External are now
// MEMBERS' OWN to pick, so the sweep neither asserts nor strips them
// (MEMBERSHIP_ROLES below). The member's own pick still writes through to
// players.membership_type when they click the button, while the sweep no longer
// reasserts membership, so the console stays authoritative between clicks. They
// are the exception because they grant nothing inside the app: they price a
// tournament entry and decide which events a member may enter, which an exec
// can see and correct in the console. Nothing else about this file changes
// direction.
//
// This module is deliberately pure — no fetch, no Discord client, no clock. The
// whole of the interesting logic (who gets what, and what a sync should change)
// is decided here so it can be tested without a guild, a token or a database.

 *    arrives already approved, and the same reason the owner asked for pending
