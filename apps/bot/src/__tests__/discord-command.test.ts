// /discord hands an exec the club's invite: the link as text and the same link
// as a QR code. It is the smallest command in the file and the one with the most
// ways to be quietly wrong, so four things are pinned here:
//
//   1. IT NEVER PRINTS A discord.gg CODE. The club's own subdomain is a
//      Cloudflare 301, and that redirect is the whole point: an invite can be
//      rotated without reprinting a poster. A raw code leaking into this reply
//      would be copied onto a slide and outlive the invite it names.
//   2. THE REPLY IS EPHEMERAL. This is the link an exec pastes somewhere
//      deliberately; the bot dropping it into a shared channel on their behalf
//      is the opposite of that.
//   3. A MISSING APP_PUBLIC_URL DEGRADES, IT DOES NOT THROW. Unlike /profile,
//      where the URL is the entire answer, here the link alone still works.
//   4. IT MAKES NO NETWORK CALL. That is what justifies keeping it out of
//      DEFERRED_COMMANDS, so it is asserted rather than assumed.
//
// Deliberately NO vi.mock of ../api.js: the handler imports nothing from it, and
// mocking it would hide exactly the network call assertion 4 exists to catch.
