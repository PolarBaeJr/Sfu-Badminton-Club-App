// Gate 2 for the officer-facing Discord routes, in one place.
//
// THE SERVICE SECRET IS NOT THE GATE. It proves the request came from the bot
// and says nothing about who typed the command: every member's slash command
// arrives with the same bearer token, and `default_member_permissions: '0'` on
// the command is a picker filter rather than authorization. So the CALLER'S
// Discord id is resolved to a club account here and that account is asked for
// `players.discordlink.write`, which is the same capability the console's
// force-link panel requires, through the same resolver, so the two cannot
// drift.
//
// WHY THE SAME CAPABILITY COVERS UNLINKING AND RESYNCING, and why no new
// permission string was invented for either: it is the same table, the same
// row and the inverse write, and capability-gates.ts already stretches this
// capability past "link" to cover READING the link row on exactly that
// reasoning. A new string would need a players_permission_vocabulary_check
// migration, and migrations here are owner-run.
//
// DELIBERATELY NOT WIRED INTO force-link/route.ts. That route carries the same
// body inline and its own header blesses the duplication; it is a live security
// path and moving it onto this helper is a separate change with its own
// review. The consolidation is a follow-up, not part of this one.
