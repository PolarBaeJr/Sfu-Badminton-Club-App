 * `players` reads and two /auth/v1/user round trips where one would do.
 *
 * react cache() is scoped to the request, so whichever of the two runs first
 * fills it and the other hits it. That is safe HERE and nowhere else: rendering
 * never mutates, so there is no write for a cached read to be stale against. A
 * server action does mutate, which is exactly why it keeps getCurrentPlayer().
 * When Next follows an action with a re-render in the same request the action
 * has already finished before anything here is called, so what lands in the
 * cache is the post-mutation row.
 *
 * `user` comes back alongside `player` because they answer different questions.
 * A member with a live session but no players row is authenticated — the layout
 * has always shown them signed-in chrome — and collapsing this to `player !==
 * null` would sign them out halfway through onboarding.
