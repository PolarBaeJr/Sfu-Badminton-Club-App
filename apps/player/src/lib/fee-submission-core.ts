// THE RULES FOR FILING A PAYMENT RECEIPT (00248, 00253), shared by both doors:
// the Membership page's server action (actions/fee-submissions.ts) and Discord
// /receipt (app/api/discord/receipts). A plain module, not a 'use server' one,
// so nothing here is reachable as a Server Action: every caller has already
// decided who the member is and has stored the screenshot at a path it built.
//
// The method is a hint for the exec, and clamped here: only dues are sold on
// the SFU Rec website, so every other line is stored as an e-transfer, and
// paying one needs the club's e-transfer address to be set. A dues receipt
// keeps the caller's answer (the browser's OCR guess), or NULL when it could
// not tell, which is always the case from Discord.
//
// Service role for every write: fee_submissions has no INSERT grant or policy
// for members, and a dues row may have to be created. Every refusal is an
// ExpectedError carrying the sentence the member sees.
