// THE MEMBER'S SIDE OF THE EVENT WAIVER.
//
// NOT a 'use server' module — these are helpers imported by the tournament
// actions, not actions themselves.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE ONE PLACE event_waiver_acceptances IS WRITTEN, AND WHY IT IS HERE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The obvious-looking way to let an exec sign somebody in at the door is an
// admin action that inserts an acceptance on the member's behalf. It must not
// exist. A row that looks like a signature but is an officer's assertion is
// worse than no row at all, because it launders exactly the liability it claims
// to record — the club would hold a document saying somebody agreed to
// something they were never shown.
//
// No column and no flag makes that safe, so the guarantee is structural: every
// write to event_waiver_acceptances happens in the PLAYER app, behind
// requirePlayer(), against the member's own session cookie. `recordEventWaiverAcceptance`
// below and the one in registerForEvent are the entire set, and a test pins
// that the admin app contains no writer at all.
//
// "Hand them a device" therefore means handing them a device they sign in on —
// their phone, or an exec's phone with the member logged in as themselves.
// The officer's claim that they did so is an audit fact, and audit facts go in
// tournament_audit_log where officer claims belong.
