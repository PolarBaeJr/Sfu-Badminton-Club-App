// The opponent list behind /challenges/new, read SERVER-SIDE and for one
// reason: `is_banned`.
//
// The picker used to build its own list in the browser, filtering active_flag
// and status and nothing else, so A BANNED MEMBER WAS OFFERED AS A
// CHALLENGEABLE OPPONENT. It could not be fixed where it broke: 00032 revoked
// blanket SELECT on `players` and the column grants for `authenticated` cover
// active_flag, status, id, full_name, handle and avatar_url but NOT is_banned
// (verified against both databases, 2026-08-17). A browser-side
// `.eq('is_banned', false)` would not narrow the list — it would 403 the whole
// request, which PostgREST hands back as an empty array, and the picker would
// silently offer nobody at all.
//
// So the read moves to the server and runs through the service-role client,
// which bypasses RLS and the column grants. The flag is used as a FILTER and
// never returned: the shape below is exactly what the browser could already
// see.
//
// SEVERITY, HONESTLY. This is a UX bug, not a hole. validate_challenge_creation
// (00048/00053) already refuses a banned opponent with "Opponent cannot accept
// challenges", and createChallenge calls it, so the challenge was never going
// to be created. What was wrong is that the form offered a name it would then
// reject at submit — the same failure the ?opponent= staleness handling in the
// client exists to avoid.
import { createServiceRoleClient } from './supabase-server';

// NO avatar_url, deliberately. The browser query it replaces SELECTED the
// column and then never mapped it into its options, so PlayerPicker has always
// been handed `avatarUrl: null` on this screen. Returning it here would start
// rendering avatars in the picker — a visual change nobody asked for, on a
// screen with unrelated work in flight. Same shape in, same shape out.
