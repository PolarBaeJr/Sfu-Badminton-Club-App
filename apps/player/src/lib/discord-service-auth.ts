// parameter the bot asserts — so nothing about the request itself proves who is
// calling. Without a service credential, `GET /api/discord/users/{discordId}`
// would let anyone who can reach the route read any linked member's profile, and
// the write routes added in phase 3 would let anyone RSVP as anyone.
//
// So: the bot authenticates as a SERVICE. `discordId` is then a claim the
// service is making, which the authorization layer still resolves and checks. A
// valid token gets you in the door and grants nothing on its own.
//
// Deliberately NOT the plain `!==` used by the cron routes in the admin app. A
// non-constant-time compare on a long-lived shared secret leaks it a byte at a
// time to anyone who can measure the response. The cron routes should move to
// this too; they are just not this branch's job.
