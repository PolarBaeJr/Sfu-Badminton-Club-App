// PROJECTING A THIRD PARTY OUT OF A ROW THAT IS ALSO ABOUT THE REQUESTER.
//
// THE RULE, applied at every site in the assembler: the requester's own fields
// come through verbatim, and every other member is reduced to a stable
// per-export opaque pseudonym (`member_1`, `member_2`, ...) or a role-level
// descriptor. NEVER A UUID AND NEVER A NAME.
//
// WHY A UUID IS THE THING TO WORRY ABOUT, rather than the name. A name is
// already semi-public in this club -- the leaderboard shows it. A player uuid
// is a JOINABLE IDENTIFIER across the whole rest of the app: it appears in
// /leaderboard/[playerId] URLs, in every realtime filter, and in every table in
// the schema. Handing one out turns this export from a record of the
// requester's information into a lookup key for somebody else's. The pseudonym
// is deliberately per-export and meaningless outside the one file, so
// `member_3` in one member's download has nothing to do with `member_3` in
// another's.
//
// NO I/O HERE either, for the same reason as the registry: the coverage test
// imports this file to check the projection mechanically.
