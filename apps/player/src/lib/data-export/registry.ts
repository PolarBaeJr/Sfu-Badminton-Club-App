// WHAT THE SYSTEM HOLDS ABOUT A MEMBER, TABLE BY TABLE, AND WHAT THE EXPORT
// DOES WITH EACH ONE.
//
// THE GOVERNING IDEA OF THIS WHOLE FEATURE. The defence against creating a
// false record of compliance is NOT including everything. It is ENUMERATING
// THE WITHHOLDINGS. An export that says what it is not giving you is
// defensible; one that silently omits is not, because the member cannot tell
// the difference between "the club holds nothing about me here" and "the club
// holds something and this file did not look". Every disposition below
// therefore carries a `why` that lands in the file the member downloads, and
// the coverage test next door refuses to let a new table exist without one.
//
// NO I/O IN THIS FILE, deliberately. The coverage test imports it and compares
// it against the migration SQL; a single import of the Supabase client here
// would make that test need an environment.
//
// THE PARTITION IS TOTAL, and that is the point. An FK-only scan of the schema
// is not enough: four tables name a member with no foreign key at all (see
// NON_FK_PLAYER_TABLES). So the test asserts that EVERY table any migration
// creates and no migration drops lands in exactly one of four buckets, and
// names the offenders when one does not. A new table then fails a test instead
// of being quietly absent from a statutory access response.

/**
 * What the export does with a table.
 *
 *   export      Wholly the requester's. Rows go into `data` as they are, minus
 *               any `withheldColumns`.
 *   project     Jointly about the requester and somebody else. Rows go into
 *               `data` rewritten requester-relative: their own fields verbatim,
 *               every other member reduced to an opaque per-export pseudonym or
 *               a role descriptor. NEVER a uuid and never a name.
 *   counted     Considered and found to record an OFFICIAL ACT rather than a
 *               personal record: the member, wearing an officer's hat, changed
 *               a club-wide object. The export carries the count and not the
 *               rows, on the same reasoning the plan applies to club_ledger --
 *               a count, not the club cashbook. This is the "N/A" disposition:
 *               the table was considered and is not the requester's record.
 *   withheld    Never in the file. The `why` is, with a row count.
 *   withheld_pending_owner_decision
 *               Officer free text written ABOUT the member. 00117 and 00118
 *               exist specifically to keep this text away from members; an
 *               export including it reverses that intent, and the FIPPA s.13 /
 *               s.19 / s.22 exceptions are not something to adjudicate in code.
 *               Surfaced with a row count so the owner can see the stakes.
