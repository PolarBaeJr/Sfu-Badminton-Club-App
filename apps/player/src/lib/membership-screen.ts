// WHAT THE TOURNAMENT PAGES KNOW ABOUT THE MEMBERSHIP GATE BEFORE THE CLICK.
//
// registerForEvent refuses an unpaid member from an internal-only event
// (00260). The pages ask the same question first, so the member reads "Club
// fee needed" above the events instead of a Register button that can only
// fail.
//
// Read on the SESSION client: seasons_select admits any signed-in member, and
// club_fees_select_own / fee_submissions_select_own each say "yours only". The
// dues rule is loadPaidDues's (a dues row for the season with paid_at set);
// the row is read here directly only so the receipt waiting on it comes back
// in the same request.
//
// Null means a read failed, and the pages then render nothing extra: the
// action still decides, and a notice built on a failed read would tell a paid
// member they owe a fee.
