/**
 * The ladder profile of somebody who is not you.
 *
 * FIX-LIST #11. `players.status` is a SELECT grant `authenticated` holds, and
 * the enum it carries is not one vocabulary but two: `competitive` /
 * `recreational` are the member's own competitive track, and `suspended` /
 * `pending_approval` are moderation decisions the club made ABOUT them.
 * /leaderboard/[playerId] read the column with the member's own key and drew
 * whichever value came back as a pill, so tapping a name in the feed told you
 * that the club had suspended that person.
 *
 * 00032's header says it withheld every moderation flag — `is_banned`,
 * `ban_reason`, `fee_exempt` were all correctly revoked. `status` was left
 * granted because of its other half, and the moderation half rode along.
 *
 * The fix is the shape challengeable-opponents.ts already uses for `is_banned`:
 * read on the server with the service-role key and COLLAPSE the value before it
 * leaves this module, so what reaches the component cannot say `suspended` at
 * all. That also frees the grant — after this, nothing in either app reads
 * `players.status` through the anon key, so 00151 can revoke it without a
 * single read going 403. (The admin console reads players exclusively through
 * createAdminClient(); the player app's other status readers — the calendar
 * feed, passkey login, reactivate, listChallengeableOpponents — are already
 * service-role.)
