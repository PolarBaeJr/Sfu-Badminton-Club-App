/**
 * THE MIDDLEWARE MUST NOT ASK GOTRUE ANYTHING ON A PUBLIC PATH.
 *
 * public-paths.test.ts asserts which paths are public. It cannot assert what
 * this file exists for: that being public actually SAVES the round trip. Those
 * are different claims, and only this one is about the middleware.
 *
 * Both gates in middleware.ts are guarded by `!isPublic`, so `user` was never
 * read on a public request -- yet every public request still built a Supabase
 * client and awaited auth.getUser(). Signed out that is nearly free (no cookie,
 * so supabase-js fails locally). Signed in it was a real GoTrue round trip,
 * measured elsewhere in this repo at 48-126ms, paid on /leaderboard and then
 * paid AGAIN in the root layout, which runs in a different runtime and cannot
 * reuse it.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASSERTED IS THE ABSENCE OF A CALL, which is worth stating plainly
 * because absence is the easy thing to assert vacuously. createServerClient is
 * mocked to a spy that throws if anyone builds a client; the non-public cases
 * at the bottom are what prove the spy is wired up and would have fired. A
 * regression that moved getUser() back above the isPublic check would fail the
 * public cases here and nowhere else in the suite.
