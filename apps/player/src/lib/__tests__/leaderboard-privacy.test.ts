// FIX-LIST #14 — "`hide_from_leaderboard` is enforced but bypassable by a click".
//
// The control is real in the database: `get_leaderboard()` has filtered on this
// flag since 00003. What it never covered is every OTHER route to the same
// number, and the feed links every match row straight to one of them.
//
// These are source assertions rather than render assertions, and deliberately.
// The defect is not "a component drew the wrong thing on one path" — it is that
// a number reached a caller at all, on paths a snapshot test would have to
// enumerate to catch. What must hold is an ALLOWLIST: the set of files in the
// members' app that can put another member's rating on a screen is small,
// closed, and each entry has a reason. A new surface has to come and edit this
// list, which is the point.
