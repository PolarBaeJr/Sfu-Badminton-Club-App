// A TABLE ABSENT FROM THE MEMBER DATA EXPORT IS INVISIBLE, AND THAT IS THE
// WHOLE HAZARD.
//
// The export's defence is not that it includes everything; it is that it
// ENUMERATES ITS WITHHOLDINGS. That defence is only as good as the list of
// tables it was built against. A migration adding a table that holds personal
// information does not break anything: the route keeps returning 200, the file
// keeps looking complete, and the only symptom is a statutory access response
// that silently omits a table. Nothing in a code review reliably catches that,
// because the reviewer is looking at the migration and not at a registry in
// another app.
//
// So the truth comes from the MIGRATIONS and the claim from the registry, and
// the assertion that matters is a TOTAL PARTITION: every table the parser finds
// must land in exactly one bucket. Not "every FK table is handled" -- four
// tables in this schema name a member with NO foreign key (email_suppressions,
// passkey_challenges, discord_role_revocations, tournament_bonus_grants), so an
// FK-derived list is incomplete by construction and would have missed all four.
//
// WHY THIS PARSES SQL AS TEXT, and the limits of that. The alternative is
// packages/shared/src/types/database.gen.ts, which is STALE -- the console's
// deleted-identity.test.ts carries a hardcoded workaround adding `exec_bio`
// back because 00130 landed and the types were never regenerated. Inheriting
// that workaround would mean inheriting the staleness it papers over. Reading
// the migrations is crude, it cannot see DDL built with EXECUTE format(...), and
// it says nothing about whether a migration has been APPLIED (nothing in this
// repository tracks that). It does check that somebody wrote the statement
// down, which is the part a code review can catch. Same technique and same
// caveat as realtime-publication.test.ts next door.
