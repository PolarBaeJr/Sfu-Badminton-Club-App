// FIX-LIST #11 — "a suspension is published to every member".
//
// `players.status` carries two unrelated vocabularies. `competitive` and
// `recreational` are the member's own competitive track and are meant to be
// public; `suspended` and `pending_approval` are moderation decisions the club
// made about them. The ladder profile drew whichever one came back, so tapping
// a name in the feed told you the club had suspended that person.
//
// Two things are asserted, and they answer different questions. The unit tests
// pin the collapse itself. The source scan pins that no OTHER file in the
// members' app reaches the raw column through the member's own key — which is
// also the precondition 00151 needs before it can revoke the grant.
