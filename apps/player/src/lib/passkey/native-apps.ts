// Which native apps may use this site's passkeys, and what the site publishes
// so the operating systems agree.
//
// A passkey is bound to an RP ID (sfubadminton.com), and a browser proves the
// page it ran on belongs to that domain by putting the page's origin in the
// signed clientDataJSON. A native app has no page, so each platform asks the
// DOMAIN to vouch for the app instead:
//
//  - Android reads /.well-known/assetlinks.json and only lets an app whose
//    signing certificate is listed there use the domain's credentials. The
//    assertion then carries `android:apk-key-hash:<base64url sha256 of the
//    cert>` as its origin, not an https origin, so the verify route has to
//    accept those strings too.
//  - iOS reads /.well-known/apple-app-site-association and wants the app's
//    TEAMID.bundle.id under `webcredentials`.
//
// Everything is read from env at call time (runtime, server-only, never
// NEXT_PUBLIC_, which Next would freeze into the image at build time). Unset
// means "no native app": the well-known files answer 404 and the app routes
// accept only the web origins, so nothing changes for a deployment that has
// not configured an app.
//
// Keep this file free of Node-only imports, like config.ts: it only needs
// btoa, and the well-known routes should not drag node:crypto in for it.
