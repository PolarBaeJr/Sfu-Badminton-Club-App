                    activate_season REBASES Elo at a rollover — compressed
                    toward the mean, or reset outright under the 'full' policy
                    in 00068 — but it resets no other counter. So the wins,
                    losses, win rate and streak printed beside that Elo are
                    cumulative across every season the member has ever played,
                    and a row reading "1847 · 18–6 · 75%" stated one
                    since-rollover figure and three all-time ones in a single
                    line with no visual seam. Tournament points are all-time
                    too: get_leaderboard() sums tournament_participants.points
                    with no season predicate and no join to tournaments.

                    Nothing stores a per-season record, so this can only be
                    labelled, not scoped. It sits on its own line because the
                    legend above is a right-aligned cell in a three-column key
                    and wraps at 400px if it is lengthened — the same trap

                    these places are not the places that were on screen at the
                    time. Privacy over fidelity, deliberately, and stated rather
