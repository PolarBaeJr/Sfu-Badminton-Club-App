// The club's runtime settings for the Discord relays: which channel each one
// posts to, and the handful of values the schema has no column for.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE ROUTE FROM /api/discord/config. That one writes the
// guild and its role mappings and refuses a payload with no roles in it
// (`no_roles`), which is right for /setup and useless here — changing the
// announcement channel is not a role change and must not require sending the
// role map along with it. It also only ever knew about `audit_channel_id`.
//
// SETTINGS ARE GLOBAL, NOT PER-GUILD. `discord_settings` has key as its whole
// primary key (00167) — there is no guild_id column. One club, one server per
// environment, so this is correct today; a second guild would need the table
// widened first, and this route rewritten with it. Deliberately not built for
// a shape that does not exist.
//
// Service-role and service-secret gated, same as every other route under
// /api/discord: there is no member session behind a bot request.

/**
 * EVERY KEY THAT MAY BE WRITTEN, AND HOW TO CHECK IT.
 *
 * A whitelist rather than "upsert whatever arrives", and that is the security
 * boundary of this route. `discord_settings` is service-role only and is read
 * by six different relays; an endpoint that accepted an arbitrary key would let
 * anything holding the service secret write config those relays trust — an
 * arbitrary-config-write primitive dressed up as a settings form.
 *
 * The bot has its own copy of this list to build the slash command from. That
 * duplication is intended: the bot's copy is a menu, this one is the rule, and
 * a bot rolled ahead of its player app must not be able to widen it.
