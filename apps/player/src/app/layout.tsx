// SELF-HOSTED, NOT next/font/google — and that is a deploy property, not a
// preference. next/font/google resolves at BUILD time: `docker build` opens a
// socket to fonts.gstatic.com, so a blip on the CI runner's network fails the
// image rather than the page. It already has. These are the exact same bytes —
// every file under src/fonts/ is sha256-identical to the one gstatic serves for
// that family, weight and subset today — vendored with their OFL 1.1 licences,
// so the build reads the disk and nothing else.
//
// Google's stylesheet does not ship one file per weight — it ships three,
// latin / latin-ext / vietnamese, sharing one font-family name and separated by
// unicode-range. localFont() cannot express that shape: every call mints its
// own private family, and the files inside one `src` array all land on that
// family with no unicode-range, so the last one listed would simply win and the
// rest would never paint. Hence one call per subset, chained back together into
// a single stack in globals.css:
//
//   --font-sans: var(--font-sans-ext), var(--font-sans-vi), var(--font-sans-latin)
//
// Order is load-bearing. The ext/vi faces carry a `unicode-range`, so they
// decline every codepoint outside their block and ordinary text still reaches
// the latin file. They must sit BEFORE it because `--font-sans-latin` ends in
// next/font's metric-matched Arial fallback, and Arial has ř and ế — listed
// after it, the subsets would never be consulted, which is the bug being fixed.
//
// preload:false on the subsets is deliberate: a roster with no accented name
// must not pay for them. A browser fetches a font only once a character it
// claims is actually painted, so those two files cost nothing until a Nguyễn
// or a Dvořák appears. adjustFontFallback:false keeps a second Arial fallback
// out of the middle of the stack; the latin call at the end supplies the one.
//
// The unicode-range values are verbatim from fonts.googleapis.com's css2 output
// for Barlow v13 and must be written inline — next/font rejects a reference
// ("Font loader values must be explicitly written literals"). Where the blocks
// overlap (U+0304, U+0308, U+0329) ext answers where Google gave it to latin:
// same family, same weight, same outline.
//
// JetBrains Mono stays latin-only. It sets labels, dates and figures, never a
// person's name. It is also a VARIABLE font: one file serves all four weights,
// which is exactly what Google's CSS did (four @font-face rules, one src).
