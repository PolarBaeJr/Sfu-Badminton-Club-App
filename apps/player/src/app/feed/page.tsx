                    `tournament_matches`, so a match-level filter would wake the
                    busiest screen in the app on every score to redraw an
                    identical card. What the card DOES show is covered without
                    it — an event going live or completing arrives on
                    `tournament_events` (watched tournament-wide, so an event
                    ADDED mid-tournament is caught too), and a check-in arrives
                    on `tournament_participants` / `tournament_pairs`, which are
                    watched per event id. Since 00120 an entry REMOVED arrives as
                    an UPDATE on `tournament_events`, which the same
                    tournament-wide listener already hears.

                    The channel name is unique per surface, which live-tournament
                    requires: `/tournaments/[id]` holds `player-tournament-${id}`
                    and the event page holds `player-tournament-event-${eventId}`,
                    so this one is prefixed `feed-` to match the app's other feed
                    channel (`feed-matches`). Several of these mount on one socket
                    — @supabase/ssr 0.5.2 caches the browser client in a module
                    singleton (`cachedBrowserClient`), so createClient() returns
