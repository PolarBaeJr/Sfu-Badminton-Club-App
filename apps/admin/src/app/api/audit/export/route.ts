/**
 * THE AUDIT LOG, AS A FILE.
 *
 * A ROUTE RATHER THAN A SERVER ACTION, because a download is a response: it
 * needs its own Content-Type, its own Content-Disposition and its own caching
 * rules, and a server action returns a value to a React tree. The panel links
 * straight at it.
 *
 * IT RE-ASKS THE QUESTION THE MIDDLEWARE ALREADY ASKED. `/api/audit/export` is
 * in SECTION_CAPABILITY, so the edge has already checked `audit.export.read`
 * before this function runs, and it is checked again here anyway. That is the
 * rule app/audit/page.tsx states for itself and the reason the gate string in
 * capability-gates.ts names this handler rather than the route: an audit
 * surface names who did what to whom, so it is the last thing in the console
 * that should rely on a match having happened upstream.
