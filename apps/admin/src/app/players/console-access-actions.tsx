// CHANGING SOMEBODY'S CONSOLE ACCESS FROM THE ROSTER, which the club owner asked
// for: "allow me to edit access from the player menu too, but only to people who
// have permission to do edits on the player menu."
//
// THIS REVERSES AN EARLIER DECISION OF THEIRS AND IS NOT THE OLD CONTROL COMING
// BACK. The one that used to live in the Edit dialog wrote role / is_exec /
// is_trainer through updatePlayer under a bare isAdmin check, with no self-edit
// refusal, no admin-target refusal and no closure test in either direction. This
// one calls setConsoleAccess — the /permissions action — so the roster and
// /permissions are the same act reached from two places rather than two writers
// that can disagree about what Admin means. player-field-access.ts still refuses
// the three columns from updatePlayer, from every caller, and that stays true:
// writeConsoleLevel is still the only thing that writes them.
//
// WHICH CAPABILITY "permission to do edits on the player menu" IS. It is
// players.consoleaccess.write, not players.update.write. setConsoleAccess
// requires the former server-side, so a control drawn for update holders would
// be a button that always refuses — and drawing it for them is exactly the
// escalation the capability was split out to prevent: somebody who may fix a
// member's phone number would be able to make themselves an executive.
//
// A COMPONENT OF ITS OWN, beside View and the two review controls rather than
// inside the tab's action set, for the reason PrivilegeReviewActions gives: the
// action set is roster-actions.ts's answer to "what does this tab offer", and a
// console level is orthogonal to the tab — an admin is an admin on Inactive too.
