/**
 * HOW COLLECTION IS GOING — the Club fees tab's chart panel.
 *
 * TWO QUESTIONS AN OFFICER ACTUALLY ASKS, and they are different questions:
 *
 *   "Have we got the money in?"   the split — a level.
 *   "Has collection stalled?"     the curve — a rate.
 *
 * The stat strip above answers neither. It counts PEOPLE (paid / outstanding /
 * waived), and the treasurer booking a gym needs dollars; forty members paid out
 * of ninety is not half the money when the two tiers are priced differently.
 * Neither figure below restates a number already on the screen.
 *
 * BEHIND `fees.clubfees.read` AND NOTHING ELSE, and it costs no query at all:
 * every row it draws was already fetched to render the fee table. See the note
 * on the fetch in page.tsx.
 *
 * DUES ONLY. `club_fees` has held entry fees and reinstatements since 00094 and
 * they answer to `tournaments.fees.read` and `fees.reinstatements.read` — other
 * people's books. This panel never sees them: the page's fee query filters
 * `fee_type = 'dues'`, and a chart splitting that table by kind is the leak
 * getClubFeeIncome's comment exists to refuse. Even a zeroed bar for a ledger
 * you may not see would disclose that it is empty.

   * was billable in a term that has ended, so on a finished season the figure
   * asserts a debt from members who may have joined since and omits members who
   * have left. A count carrying that approximation is one thing; a dollar
