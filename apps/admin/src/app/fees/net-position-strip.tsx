/**
 * "Are we in the positives?" — the club owner's actual question, answered at
 * the top of the money page whichever tab is open.
 *
 * Presentational only. Every figure comes from the SeasonFinances object the
 * page already fetched; nothing here sums a row. Two pages independently
 * summing money is how the income figure came to read $0.00 while the money sat
 * in the database, and a component that does its own arithmetic is a third.
 *
 * Drawn as the console's `.stat-strip` rather than as three cards. The design
 * guidance reserves card chrome for content and asks for headline figures as a
 * hairline-divided row of bare label/value pairs — the same primitive the
 * dashboard already uses for its counts, so the two money summaries in the
 * console now read as one thing seen twice rather than as two designs.
 *
 * The one place this departs from `.stat-strip`: the shipped `.stat-value` rule
 * sets `--display`, and every figure here is money. Money is compared digit by
 * digit between rows, so it is `--mono` throughout the console and overriding
 * the font here is what keeps the three totals column-aligned with the amounts
 * in the ledgers below them.
