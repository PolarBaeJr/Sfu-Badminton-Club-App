/**
 * Open the receipt attached to an expense (00231).
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES UNDER /fees AND NOT UNDER /api. This is the one thing about this
 * file that is not obvious and is worth getting right once. canAccess() resolves
 * a path through longestPrefixMatch over SECTION_CAPABILITY and returns
 * `level === 'admin'` for any path nothing claims (permissions.ts:250): fail
 * closed, deliberately. The middleware matcher covers everything including
 * /api/*, so a handler at /api/receipts would be an UNCLAIMED path, and the
 * middleware would 307 a finance-role exec to /dashboard before this code ran.
 * The exec who files the club's expenses is exactly the person this feature is
 * for, so that would have broken it for its main user while working perfectly
 * for an admin testing it.
 *
 * Sitting here, '/fees/receipt/<id>' matches the existing '/fees' prefix and
 * resolves to `fees.page`, which the exec holds. So this file needs NO
 * SECTION_CAPABILITY entry and no new row in the permissions matrix, and the
 * gate below is what actually decides who may open a receipt.
 *
 * THE GATE IS fees.expenses.read, the same capability that renders the row. It
 * is not a new capability: seeing what the club spent and seeing the receipt
 * behind it are one act, and minting a second key would have meant an admin
 * ticking two boxes to grant one thing. `fees.page` gets you to the section and
 * says nothing about the ledgers inside it, which is why the check is repeated
 * here rather than left to the middleware. requireCapability throws, and the
 * passkey gate applies as it does to every other privileged surface: a receipt is
 * private financial evidence, so this is not a place to pass { skipPasskey }.
 *
 * A 302 TO A SHORT-LIVED SIGNED URL, rather than streaming the bytes back
 * through this process. The file goes browser-to-storage on the way in and
 * storage-to-browser on the way out, so a multi-megabyte photo never crosses the
 * single Node thread that renders every other page in the console. Sixty seconds
 * is enough for a browser to follow a redirect it was handed and short enough
 * that a URL copied out of devtools is stale before it is useful. The row keeps
 * the PATH, so a fresh one can always be signed.
 *
 * ONE SIGNING PER CLICK. Nothing here runs at render time: the ledger draws a
 * plain link, and a page of forty expenses signs forty URLs only if somebody
 * opens forty receipts. Signing on render would have meant forty signatures and
 * forty URLs in the RSC payload, all expiring while the page sat open.
