/**
 * The row list for one of the two non-fee ledgers (00073).
 *
 * IT SHOWS A TOTAL NOW, AND THE RULE THAT FORBADE ONE IS INTACT. This card used
 * to refuse a subtotal outright: a card that summed its own rows would be a
 * second implementation of the same total sitting inches from the first, and
 * the two would disagree the moment one of them changed — which is exactly how
 * the income headline came to read $0.00 while money sat in the database.
 *
 * What that rule actually forbids is a second piece of ARITHMETIC, and
 * LedgerCharts below is not one: it folds these rows through the same
 * `summariseExpenseRows` / `foldLedgerRows` the season figures come out of, so
 * the number at the head of this card is the same number by construction rather
 * than by two people remembering one rule. The refusal was also costing a real
 * reader — the net-position strip is behind `fees.netposition.read`, which an
 * exec does not hold, so the person who files the club's expenses was shown
 * every row of this ledger and no total anywhere on the page.
 *
 * The list still answers "what is in here" and the charts answer "how much, and
 * when". Neither asks the database for anything: the rows are already here.
 *
 * A row with no paid_at is excluded from those totals, so it is badged "Not
 * recorded" here rather than looking identical to a counted row. A filtered-out
 * row that looks the same as a counted one is a row nobody knows is missing.
 *
 * REIMBURSEMENT STATE (00077) IS SHOWN TO EVERYONE WHO CAN SEE THE ROW,
 * including execs — that is the whole point of the feature for them: an exec
 * who bought shuttles out of pocket comes here to find out whether the club has
 * paid them back. Seeing the state and changing it are separate capabilities.

 * fees.expenses.reimburse.write without making them an admin. Four booleans
 * rather than a level, because there are four actions and they are separately
