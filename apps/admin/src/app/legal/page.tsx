//
// legal.read is what opens the section, and an exec holds it. Editing asks for
// legal.documents.write and legal.waivertemplate.write, which no baseline below
// admin holds; requiring a re-signature asks for legal.reacceptance.write, which
// every exec holds.
//
// EVERY FETCH BELOW IS GATED ON THE CAPABILITY ITS DATA NEEDS, not on the page
// key and not on "is this person an admin". The signature panel is the reason
// this matters: it reads the ROSTER — names, photos, who has not signed — which
// is players.read, a different key from the one that opened this section. A
// conditional render over an unconditional query does not withhold anything;
// the rows still ship inside the RSC payload and are readable with devtools.
// So the query itself is skipped, and the panel renders a sentence saying so.
