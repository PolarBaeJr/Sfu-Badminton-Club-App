          degraded entry is a real fact with its detail missing, and it is
          counted here and badged in the list.

          The honest limit, which is why this line is unconditional: an entry
          lost ENTIRELY leaves no row, so no screen can count it. Zero degraded
          entries means none were degraded, not that none were lost. */}
