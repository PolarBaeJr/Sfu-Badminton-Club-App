            revoked from every application role (00072). Somebody reading a row

            It says DELETED and not "append-only", because append-only would be
            a stronger claim than the schema makes and it is not true: merging
            two members runs `UPDATE audit_logs SET actor_id` in a SECURITY
            DEFINER function (00026, 00079), which bypasses RLS entirely. So a
            row's ACTOR can be repointed — deliberately, so the history follows
            the surviving member — while the row itself cannot be deleted. That
            is the whole promise this footer is allowed to make. Do not read the
            policy list above as proof of immutability, and do not put the word
            back. */}
