  // It used to print one side's digits per row — "21 15 21" over "19 21 18" —
  // and the note here defended that as "how a printed draw sheet has always
  // shown it". The defence was true and beside the point: a printed draw sheet
  // is not 196px wide. Those eight mono characters cost the row 53px plus its
  // gap, which left the name field 97.2px, and a stacked doubles partner —
  // "Bartholomew Fairweather" at 112.1px — did not fit in it. The comment on
  // `Side` recorded that as a residue and named the price of closing it: moving
  // the score off the entrant rows. This is that move.
  //
  // WHAT IT COSTS: the reader no longer sees at a glance which side took which
  // game from the digits' own alignment. That is a smaller loss than it sounds —
  // the games are printed as pairs in A's reading order, the winner's row already
  // carries the success wash and the inset bar, and the loser's name is struck
  // through — and it is the same trade the player app's chart card made, for the
  // same reason and at a wider column than this one.

  // instead of 19, on a strip that also has to carry a status word.

          MEASURED against the compiled CSS with the real Barlow files. A pair
          label is two whole names joined — "Jonathan Smithson / Katarzyna
          Kowalski" is 228.5px at 13px — so unstacked it printed about eight
          characters of thirty-eight and named neither of them. Stacking fixed
          most of that and left a residue this note used to record: the field was
          97.2px once a best-of-3's digits were on the row, and "Bartholomew
          Fairweather" is 112.1px at 10px, so the longest partner name still
          ellipsized.
          THE DIGITS HAVE GONE TO THE FOOTER, which is what that residue was
          waiting for — see the note on `scoreLine`. The field is now the whole
          196px column less 16px of padding, the 16px seed gutter and 6px of gap:
          158px, on EVERY card rather than only on the unplayed ones. 112.1px in
          158px is 46px of headroom, so the longest name in the sample fits with
          the next several to spare.
          STILL 10px, NOT 11. The two entrant rows are `flex-1` inside an 88px
          card, so each is about 22.5px, and two 11px lines at leading-[1.05] are
          23.1px of text — the overflow-hidden shave this card has already been
          bitten by once. The width is the win here; the type size is not on
          offer without moving CARD_H, and CARD_H is what makes the whole card a
          44px tap target at the 0.5 zoom floor.
          A singles name, or a pair with a name of its own, is one line at 13px
          exactly as before. `title` carries the full label for a mouse; the
          card's aria-label already carries it for a reader. */}
