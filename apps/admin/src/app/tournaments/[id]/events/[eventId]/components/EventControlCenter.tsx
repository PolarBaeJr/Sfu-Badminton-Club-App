// 'pool' is a tab of its own rather than a mode of 'bracket' (00107). On a
// pool_to_bracket event BOTH halves exist at once from the moment the knockout
// is drawn, and they are different things to look at: the pool is a table and a
// fixture list, the bracket is a tree. One tab that switched between them would
// hide half the event behind a control, and would have no answer for the exec
// who wants the standings open while entering a quarter-final.
// 'courts' is where an event is RUN rather than recorded — named "Court
// Management" at the owner's request, having shipped as "Desk". Everything else
// here is a view of what has happened; this one carries the facts the console
// never had: which court a match is on, who is standing in front of you, which
// one is next, which one is being played, and — since the owner asked for score
// entry "on this side instead of the main thing" — the result too.
//
// A TAB OF ITS OWN because the bracket card is a single <button>, so the court
// input and the ready pills inside a row would nest interactives.
//
// THE ID IS NOT STORED ANYWHERE. It is `useState` only — no URL, no
// localStorage — so renaming it from 'desk' orphans nothing. Capability strings
// are the opposite (they live in permission_grants and
// permission_baselines.capabilities as data) and none of them was touched.
