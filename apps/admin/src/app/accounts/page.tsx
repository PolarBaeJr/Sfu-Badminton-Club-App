// TWO QUESTIONS, ONE PAGE, AND THEY ARE BOTH CALLED "ACCOUNTS".
//
// The screen the club asked for is about the OFFICERS' accounts — who holds the
// console and who can undo things with it. The page that was already here is
// about MEMBERS' accounts — challenge limits, session caps, what a membership
// may do. Both are on it now, and the settings half is not optional: this route
// is the catch-all in platform-setting-sections.ts (DEFAULT_SECTION =
// 'accounts'), so a platform_settings key added next year with no line in that
// map lands HERE. Replacing the page with an officers screen would have made
// six settings groups, and every future one, unreachable from the console with
// no error anywhere — the silent-nothing-happened failure that file was written
// to prevent.
//
// THREE CAPABILITIES, THREE ANSWERS, and the second and third are checked here
// rather than inherited from the first:
//
//   accounts.page      opens the route. requireCapability, as before.
//   permissions.page   the OFFICER data — names, emails, last sign-ins,
//                      capability counts and the access audit trail. There is
//                      no `accounts.<resource>.read`, and inventing one would
//                      mean editing the vocabulary; this is the capability that
//                      already governs exactly this data, on /permissions.
//   platform.page      the settings form, exactly as /ratings does it.
//
// The gated halves skip their FETCHES rather than hiding rendered output. A
// hidden card whose query still ran ships officer emails into the RSC payload
// for anyone with devtools — the same reasoning as /fees and dashboard/page.tsx.
//
// None of the three is in EXEC_BASELINE, and EDITOR_OFFERABLE is EXEC_BASELINE,
// so today only an admin holds any of them and both withheld branches are
// unreachable. They are written anyway, for the reason /ratings gives for
// platform.page: the route map decides who may OPEN a section, and a page that
// re-checks what it draws does not have to be re-audited when that changes.

                  The mockup drew five selects mapping jobs like "Suspend or ban"
                  onto "President only" / "President + treasurer". That is a
                  second, incompatible authorisation model: those names are not
                  roles this app has (exec_title is free text, guarded by 00072),
                  and a control that wrote them would be a second source of truth
                  for who may do what, sitting next to a resolver that would go
                  on ignoring it. So the card reports instead of deciding, the
                  text comes out of ROLE_DEFAULTS and CAPABILITY_GATES rather
                  than out of a sentence somebody typed, and the one control on
                  it is a link to the screen that really does this. */}
