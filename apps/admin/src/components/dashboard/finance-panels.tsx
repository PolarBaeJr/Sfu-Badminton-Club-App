/**
 * THE FINANCE PANELS OF THE DASHBOARD, ONE PER CAPABILITY.
 *
 * Every component here is handed data that has ALREADY been fetched under the
 * capability that owns it. Not one of them asks the permission model anything,
 * and not one of them fetches: the gate is the fetch, in dashboard/page.tsx and
 * lib/dashboard-finance.ts, because a hidden panel whose query still ran has
 * already shipped the club's books into the RSC payload. Four live leaks of
 * exactly that shape have been found in this console, including one that put
 * the club's price list in front of anyone holding fees.expenses.read.
 *
 * SO THE PANELS ARE DELIBERATELY DUMB, and the money never crosses a boundary
 * here: there is no component below that adds two ledgers together. The net
 * position — the one figure that spans every book — takes its numbers from
 * getSeasonFinances under fees.netposition.read and from nothing else, so a
 * viewer holding a single ledger read cannot reconstruct a total out of the
 * panels they were given.
 *
 * WHAT A SECOND AREA WOULD NEED, AND WHERE IT WOULD LIVE. Not here. The shapes
 * these panels are made of are in @/components/charts and the maths is in
 * @/lib/charts, both area-agnostic and both meant for /fees, /sessions,
 * /players, /seasons, /tournaments, /ratings and /audit as much as for this
 * page. THIS file is the money-specific composition: which tone, which label,
 * which sentence when the ledger is empty. An attendance panel is the same four
 * primitives with a different fetch in front of them and a different set of
 * words around them, and it belongs beside its own screen or beside this one —
 * never inside the primitives.
