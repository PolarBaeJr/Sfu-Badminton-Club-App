/**
 * Pick which season a page is showing.
 *
 * Was a row of chips, one per season. That is fine for three and unusable for
 * a club that has been running five years: the row wraps to several lines,
 * pushes the page content down on every scoped page, and finding a particular
 * term means reading every label.
 *
 * Built on the shared Select, so it has the same list, keyboard handling and
 * phone picker as every other dropdown in the console. Search matches the name
 * and the dates independently, so "2027", "fall" and "fall 27" all find Fall
 * 2027. Worth having because season names sort badly: "Fall 2026" comes before
 * "Spring 2026" alphabetically, which is backwards, so scanning a long list is
 * genuinely slow.
 *
 * The selection lives in the URL rather than in React state: these pages are
 * server components that re-query per season, so it has to survive a
 * navigation, and it makes a particular term a link somebody can send.
