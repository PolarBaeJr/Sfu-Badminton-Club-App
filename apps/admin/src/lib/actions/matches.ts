/**
 * Record an exec's free text about a match, in the private table that holds it.
 *
 * ONE CALLER LEFT: adminCreateMatch. Void and Convert used to come through
 * here too; since 00203 they are single transactions in SQL that write their
 * own note, because in one transaction a failed note write can take the whole
 * mutation with it and there is no partial state to report. What follows is
 * why this shape is still right for the caller that remains.
 *
 * A SEPARATE STATEMENT, NEVER FOLDED INTO THE MATCH WRITE. `match_admin_notes`
 * arrives with migration 00117, which the owner applies by hand — so this
 * console can be, and routinely is, deployed against a database that has never
 * heard of the table. Written as part of the `matches` insert, an absent table
 * would fail the WHOLE statement and `if (error) throw` would turn recording a
 * match into a red toast for the sake of an annotation nobody asked about.
 * Isolated here, the match is still recorded and the note is a silent no-op
 * until the SQL lands.
 *
 * This is the same shape as the `require_scan_to_check_in` write in
 * lib/actions/sessions.ts (00116), with one difference worth naming: there the
 * pre-migration failure is a missing COLUMN (PGRST204 / 42703), here it is a
 * missing TABLE (PGRST205 / 42P01). isMissingNoteTableError knows the
 * difference; the sessions predicate would not have caught it.
 *
 * IT NEVER THROWS, AND IT DISTINGUISHES THREE OUTCOMES rather than two. The
 * two-way version — "null means fine" — collapses "written" and "the table is
 * not there yet" into one answer, and the caller needs them apart: the audit
 * row must not claim a note it does not have, and the exec must not be nagged
 * about a migration they cannot run from the console.
 *
 *   recorded: true            the row is in the database.
 *   recorded: false, no error 00117 has not been applied here. Silent: the
 *                             reason is not LOST — logAdminAudit writes the
 *                             same text to audit_logs.reason — and there is
 *                             nothing the person clicking Confirm could do
 *                             about it.
 *   error                     a real failure. Loud, always, because after
 *                             00117 is applied a swallowed failure would end
 *                             in a green toast and the exec would walk away
 *                             believing a reason was recorded that was not.
 *
 * UPSERT, because one match has one note — `match_id` is the primary key.

  // written by on_match_confirmed, an AFTER UPDATE trigger, so a row BORN
  // confirmed was never counted by anything: an unrated admin match has never
  // appeared in any member's head-to-head record or partnership card.
  //
  // Inserting it unconfirmed and flipping it at the end (below) means the
  // counters are written by the same UPDATE that has always written them, at a
  // moment when the participants and games actually exist.
  //
  // WHY 'incomplete' AND NOT 'pending_confirmation' FOR THE UNRATED ONE. This
  // is the whole reason the status is still conditional, and getting it wrong
  // would trade one integrity bug for a worse one.
  //
  // apply_match_result decides whether to apply Elo on `event_type = 'casual'`,
  // NOT on rated_flag — and an admin-entered match is 'admin_entered'. Its only
  // other gate is `result_status = 'pending_confirmation'`. So a match parked at
  // 'pending_confirmation' with rated_flag FALSE is one RPC away from being
  // rated: confirmMatchResult in the player app (apps/player/src/lib/actions/
  // matches.ts) checks nothing but "are you a participant", the submitter guard
  // does not bite because the submitter is the ADMIN, and an unrated match would
  // quietly receive Elo. That window does not exist today because the match is
  // never pending; opening it here — between these two writes, and permanently
  // if the confirm below fails — would be a new hole dug by a fix for two
  // others.
  //
  // 'incomplete' has none of that reach. apply_match_result refuses it,
  // dispute_match_result refuses it (00027 accepts only pending_confirmation
  // and confirmed), reverse_match_result refuses it, and it is already the
  // status submit_match_result uses for a match row that is not a finished
  // result (00030) — which is exactly what a half-written admin entry is. The
  // console lists every status and offers void/convert on anything not voided,
  // so a stranded one is visible and recoverable, and it is badged honestly.
  //
  // AND THE INVARIANT THAT MAKES THIS SAFE ALONGSIDE THE DATABASE HALF is
  // unchanged by the conditional: neither branch is 'confirmed'. 00119 also
  // closes gap 1 in the database, with a trigger that counts a match when its
  // participants arrive and it is ALREADY confirmed — because service_role can
  // insert a confirmed match through PostgREST from any code path anybody
  // writes later, and a rule that lives only here is a rule that lasts until
  // the second call site. That trigger and discardIncompleteMatch below must
  // never both act on one match, or the cleanup would delete a match whose
