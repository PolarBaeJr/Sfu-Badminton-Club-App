// MINTING AND REVOKING THE DATA API'S KEYS.
//
// THE PLAINTEXT KEY EXISTS FOR THE LENGTH OF ONE FUNCTION CALL. It is generated
// here, hashed here, and returned to the caller; what reaches the database is a
// sha256 digest and a six-character display prefix. Nothing writes it to a log,
// to Sentry, to an audit row or to an error message, and the three places that
// could do so by accident are called out where they occur. 00241's table
// comment makes the same statement from the database's side: the key exists
// nowhere in it.
//
// WHY THE KEY IS GENERATED IN NODE AND NOT IN POSTGRES. The obvious SQL version
// is an RPC that mints and hashes server-side and returns the plaintext. That
// plaintext then travels back through PostgREST as a response body and, far
// worse, any SQL-side generation that took the plaintext as an argument would
// put it in a bound parameter, where `log_statement`, a slow-query report or a
// PostgREST log line can capture it. A key in a log is a key that has left the
// club. Hashing in Node means the only thing that ever crosses the wire to the
// database is the digest.
//
// EVERY EXPORTED PARAMETER BELOW IS A CLIENT-CONTROLLED POST FIELD. That is not
// a warning about the UI, it is the shape of a server action: a hand-rolled
// POST reaches these signatures directly. So neither function takes an actor
// id, a consumer id, a player_ref, a key, a hash or a prefix. The actor is
// resolved server-side by requireCapability, the consumer is resolved by name,
// and the key material is made here.
