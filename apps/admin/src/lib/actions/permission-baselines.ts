// THE BASELINES THE CLUB WRITES FOR ITSELF.
//
// ROLE_DEFAULTS is four VP jobs in a compile-time constant, so a fifth is a
// deploy. These are rows, and an admin makes one on /permissions.
//
// A BASELINE IS COPIED ONTO A ROW, NEVER RESOLVED THROUGH. Assigning one writes
// permission_role = 'custom' (the empty base) and the baseline's capabilities
// into permission_grants — see the header of 00093 for why, and for the 22 call
// sites that shape avoids touching. Everything in this file follows from that
// one decision:
//
//   * ASSIGNING is not here. It goes through setPlayerPermissions, which already
//     runs the five closure checks per person, and which gained one optional
//     field (`baselineId`) that makes it load the baseline and copy it. There is
//     no second write path to players.permission_* and there must never be.
//
//   * EDITING has to PROPAGATE, because the copies do not update themselves.
//     Every holder is re-written in one act, each write closure-checked and
//     audited on its own. That is more traceable than ROLE_DEFAULTS, where
//     changing what 'finance' means leaves no row in this database at all — but
//     it is N writes and not a transaction, and the failure handling below says
//     so out loud rather than hiding it.
//
//   * DELETING is refused while anybody holds one. players.permission_baseline_id
//     is ON DELETE RESTRICT, so the database refuses it too; this is the refusal
//     in words, naming the people, which a foreign-key violation cannot do.
//
// GRANT CLOSURE APPLIES AT AUTHORING TIME AS WELL AS AT ASSIGNMENT. An author
// may only put capabilities in a baseline that they themselves hold, and the
// contents are capped at EDITOR_OFFERABLE — the two rules baselineCapabilityRefusal
// implements. Without the first, a narrowly-scoped holder of permissions.write
// could write down a baseline nobody but an admin could ever assign; without the
// second, an admin could author one containing permissions.write and then meet
// check 5 of setPlayerPermissions every time they tried to use it.
