  // ban true rather than hoped for. So re-stamping it on a ban that was never
  // lifted does two things, one certain and one racy:
  //
  //   * CERTAIN. banned_at, banned_by and ban_reason are overwritten, and until
  //     this commit the audit row for a ban carried no old_value at all — so the
  //     original moderation decision (who banned them, when, and what for) was
  //     destroyed with no trace anywhere in the database.
  //   * RACY, AND THIS IS WHAT THE INDEX WAS FOR. reinstatePlayer's own note:
  //     two admins submitting the same reinstatement at once "both read
  //     is_banned = true, so the precondition above cannot separate them — they
  //     snapshot the same banned_at and the index does". Slide a re-ban between
  //     the two reads and they no longer snapshot the same value: one inserts a
  //     fee keyed on T1, the other on T2, the unique index cannot collide them,
  //     and the member is charged twice for one ban.
  //
  // A no-op would leave the exec's typed reason silently discarded and report
  // success for a write that did not happen. A refusal says what is true, and it
  // is the same shape as reinstatePlayer's "not banned, so there is nothing to
  // reinstate" one screen down. Unreachable from the console — rosterActionsFor
  // offers Unban and never Ban for a banned member — which is exactly the
  // approvePlayer situation: a client-side rule guarding a server action is a
  // suggestion, and this is the guarantee.

  // triggers, on the stated grounds that "a check in application code is a
  // suggestion; this is the guarantee". is_banned was not one of the three,
  // because in 00050's day a banned admin still passed is_admin() and still
  // opened the console.
  //
  // 00140 ended that in both places at once: is_admin() and is_admin_or_coach()
  // now return FALSE for a banned admin (45 + 3 RLS policies), and
  // requireAdminPlayer refuses them with 'Account suspended pending
  // reinstatement' before any capability is resolved. So banning the last
  // passkey-holding admin is a full lockout whose only recovery is a manual
  // UPDATE against production — and players.ban.write is EXEC-level, so an exec
  // can do it to every admin the club has.
  //
  // Counted through admins_with_passkeys(), the same function
  // guard_last_admin_role calls, rather than a second transcription of the join:
  // enrolled_via = 'admin' matters (00051) and a copy would drift. 00126 revoked
  // it from anon and authenticated and kept the service_role grant, which is the
  // client this runs on.
  //
  // THIS LINE IS NOT COMPLETE ON ITS OWN AND THE COMPANION MIGRATION IS WHY.
  // admins_with_passkeys filters role = 'admin' and does NOT filter is_banned,
  // so with one admin already banned it still counts them as a live door and
  // would let this ban through. 00145 adds the missing clause — and the
