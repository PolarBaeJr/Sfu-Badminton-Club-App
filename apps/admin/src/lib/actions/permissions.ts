/**
 * Give somebody the console, or take it away — the other half of /permissions,
 * and the half the page's own subtitle has always promised.
 *
 * THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE SOMEBODY'S CONSOLE ACCESS. `role`, `is_exec`
 * and `is_trainer` are the hard floor in player-field-access.ts, and the member
 * Edit dialog used to reach them through updatePlayer() under nothing but an
 * `isAdmin` check. The club owner removed that control — "i dont think the
 * console access should be there anymore… as its only admins who will be mainly
 * editing permissions" — and updatePlayer now refuses the three columns from
 * every caller, so the level write lives here and nowhere else.
 *
 * (The one other writer of those columns on an EXISTING member is
 * resolvePrivilegeClaimReview in actions/players.ts, which puts back exactly what
 * a roster claim withheld under this same capability. Creating a member can set
 * is_exec / is_trainer at insert, behind the admin-only
 * assertPlayerCreateFieldAccess, because 00132's claim attribution depends on an
 * exec being able to pre-add an officer.)
 *
 * (Worth knowing while reading that: the guard_player_privileged_columns trigger
 * names the same columns and does NOT cover this path. It opens with `IF
 * auth.uid() IS NULL … RETURN NEW`, and every admin action writes through the
 * service-role client where auth.uid() is NULL — see the header of
 * player-field-access.ts, verified against the live definition. The trigger
 * protects a member editing their own row through PostgREST. The application
 * guard is the only one standing here.)
 *
 * THIS USED TO BE ADMIN BY LEVEL AND IS NOW A CAPABILITY — the club owner's
 * "also make role change a permission". What stood here was an isAdminActor()
 * check whose stated reason was that handing out a level is the one act the
 * capability system deliberately cannot express, so `permissions.write` — which
 * an exec may hold — must not be mistaken for permission to do it.
 *
 * THAT REASONING IS NARROWED RATHER THAN OVERTURNED, and the part of it that
 * survives is the part that matters. `permissions.write` still is not permission
 * to hand out a level: a SECOND capability, `players.consoleaccess.write`, is
 * required, and it is in no baseline, so nobody holds it who was not given it by
 * name. What it may hand out is `executive` and `trainer` and nothing else —
 * making somebody an ADMIN, and touching anybody who already is one, still
 * require isAdminActor(). If a capability could mint an admin, holding it would
 * be equivalent to being one and the hard floor would be decorative.
 *
 * ONE CAPABILITY, AND DELIBERATELY NOT `permissions.write` AS WELL. Requiring
 * both was the obvious shape and it would have made the feature inert:
 * `permissions.write` is outside EDITOR_OFFERABLE, so check 5 of
 * setPlayerPermissions refuses to grant it and only an admin can ever hold it.
 * A gate that asks for it is a gate only admins pass, which is what this change
 * exists to stop being true. The composition clear below therefore goes through
 * applyPlayerPermissions rather than the gated action — see the note there.
 *
 * GRANT CLOSURE IS WHAT MAKES IT SAFE, checked in both directions and against
 * the LEVEL BASELINES rather than a delta: what the target holds now must be
 * inside the actor's own set, and what they would hold after the change must be
 * too. That is also what graduates exec from trainer without a second
 * capability — promoting somebody to executive hands them EXEC_BASELINE, so only
 * an actor holding all of it may do it, while a trainer-sized actor can still
 * promote somebody to varsity trainer.
 *
 * THAT BAR DROPPED FROM 73 CAPABILITIES TO 12 when the exec baseline became
 * read-only, and it dropped for the right reason: the promotion now confers
 * twelve reads and no writes, so the closure test measures what is actually
 * being handed over. The writes follow separately, through setPlayerPermissions,
 * where each is closure-checked on its own.
