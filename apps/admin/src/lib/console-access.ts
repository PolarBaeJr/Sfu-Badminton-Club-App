// WHAT CONSOLE ACCESS SOMEBODY HAS, as one question with four answers, and the
// translation between that answer and the three columns that store it.
//
// ONE MAPPING, AND NOW ONE EDITING SCREEN. This began inside the player Edit
// dialog and moved here when /permissions grew a console-access control of its
// own, because two places that both turn "Admin" into a role and two booleans is
// two places that can disagree about what Admin means. The club owner has since
// taken the control off the Edit dialog entirely — "as its only admins who will
// be mainly editing permissions" — so /permissions is the only screen that SETS
// a level. /accounts still reads the mapping, to label a level it is showing.
//
// NOT a 'use server' module and deliberately free of any Supabase, Next or React
// import — a server action and a client component both import it, which is the
// same rule ./player-field-access.ts states for itself.
//
// This module does NOT write anything and is not a boundary. The three columns
// it names are the hard floor in ./player-field-access.ts, refused to anyone
// below admin under all circumstances and reachable by no capability; the write
// goes through writeConsoleLevel() in actions/permissions.ts, which is the one
// writer of them on an existing member and is not exported. updatePlayer() used
// to be the other one and now refuses them from every caller.

 *
