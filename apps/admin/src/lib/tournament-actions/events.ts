   * THE ELO MULTIPLIER, AND WHY IT GETS NO seeding_method-STYLE CARVE-OUT.
   *
   * The number was reachable only at creation until now — createTournamentEvent
   * took it, this function took it, and no form on either dialog sent it — so an
   * event set up at the wrong weight stayed at the wrong weight for its whole
   * life. Event Settings now sends it, which is the whole of the fix.
   *
   * It is tempting to exempt it from the "no draw, still editable" gate above,
   * because unlike the match format it is not baked into the draw: it is read
   * once per RESULT, by applyTournamentMatchElo, off the event row as it stands
   * at that moment. An event that has been drawn but not played would take a new
   * value perfectly consistently.
   *
   * IT IS NOT EXEMPTED, because the same property is what makes it dangerous one
   * match later. Change it after round one has been rated and the event's early
   * rounds were rated at the old weight while its later ones take the new — and
   * nothing anywhere records which was which. `elo_snapshot` stores
   * `{discipline, entries[{before, after, delta, won, …}]}` and NOT the
   * multiplier that produced the delta, so the split is unreconstructible after
   * the fact. Meanwhile the console now PRINTS the weight per round (the bracket
   * tab's "Played to" strip and this dialog's ladder, both via
   * eloWeightBreakdown), and both read the event's current value — so every
   * already-rated round would start displaying a figure that was never applied
   * to it. That is the "silently restate history" case, and the honest options
   * are to refuse it or to record what each match was rated under. Recording it
   * needs a column, and this branch is not taking a migration.
   *
   * So the unmodified gate — no matches, still editable — is the right one here
   * too, and it is STRICTLY SAFER than "no rated matches": it refuses at the
   * draw rather than at the first result, with a sentence that names the reason.
   * Once a column exists to stamp the applied multiplier on each match, this is
   * the comment to revisit.
