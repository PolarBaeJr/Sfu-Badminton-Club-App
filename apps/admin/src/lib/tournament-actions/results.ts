  // The status condition is the one that matters most. Every guard above was
  // checked against a row that was read and then let go of, so a desk entering
  // the result of a match this request read as `ready` left it `completed`,
  // rated and advanced — and this write then stamped `ready` back over it with

  // reads as unplayed to everything that counts it, so finalizeEvent's
  // "N match(es) still incomplete" refuses the event outright, and the only
  // record that a delta was applied is a column nothing looks at any more.
  //
  // BOTH SLOTS ARE PINNED NULL-AWARE rather than through matchSlotFilter, and

  // pending -> pending either way. So two desks filling the SAME empty slot both
  // read `pending`, both pass the "that slot is already filled" guard, and the
  // second silently evicts the first. `.is(col, null)` expresses "still empty",

// ============================================================
// Admin override — change a result that has already been resolved
// ============================================================
//
// WHAT WAS ACTUALLY BLOCKING THIS: nothing on the server. This function has
// existed since the schema did, it is exported from the tournament-actions
// barrel, and it was called by ZERO client code. The bracket's MatchCard gates
// both of its buttons on `!isCompleted`, so a completed or walkover match
// rendered a "Final" / "WALKOVER" label and no control at all. The only route to
// a correction was void → restore → re-enter, which throws the original result
// away and re-rates from scratch.
//
// So the fix is an affordance, not a relaxed rule. NO EXISTING GUARD IS
// WEAKENED. Two are TIGHTENED, because the new button makes reachable what was
// previously only reachable from a test:
//
//   * The downstream check is now assertDownstreamUndecided, the same one void
//     and undo use. The hand-rolled copy that lived here checked only
//     `status === 'completed'`, so a downstream WALKOVER — the shape a late
//     withdrawal produces — waved the edit straight through, and a semi-final
//     could be rewritten underneath a final that had already been forfeited and
//     rated. It also looked at winner_to_match_id alone, which since 00080
//     misses the third-place playoff entirely.
//
//   * The match must actually HAVE a result. This wrote winner/loser onto the
//     row unconditionally and then re-rated only if the status was already
//     decided — so "editing" a pending match stamped a winner on it, skipped the
//     rating, and left a match that reads as decided to every downstream reader
//     while enterMatchResult still considered it playable and would rate it.
//
// RATING REVERSAL GOES THROUGH reverse_tournament_match_rating (00078) AND
// NOWHERE ELSE. That is the one thing this function must never grow a shortcut
// for: reverseEloSnapshot is a thin wrapper over that RPC, the RPC clears the
// snapshot inside the same transaction as the deltas it subtracts, and a second
// hand-rolled reversal path is exactly how the double-reverse defect 00078
// documents came about. Reverse, then re-apply — never adjust in place.
//
// EXEC OR ADMIN, not admin-only, and that is a deliberate deviation worth
// stating. Every other corrective action in this module — void, undo, restore,
// slot editing, double no-show — sits in EXEC_ASSIGNABLE and in
// ROLE_DEFAULTS.tournaments, and the tournament desk runs as exec, not admin.
// (They were in EXEC_BASELINE, held by every officer, until that list narrowed
// to reads; the desk now needs the Tournaments job assigned, which is the same
// authority named rather than assumed.) An admin-only override would mean the person
// standing at the desk at 9pm with a wrong scoreline on the board cannot fix it,
// which is the situation this was asked for. What makes the override safe is not
// a narrower role but that it is EXPLICIT and AUDITED: it demands a typed
// reason, and the audit row carries the old AND new winner, the old AND new
// scores, and whether the rating was reversed and re-applied.

// "once a game is scored, show a summary". The figures are THIS EVENT's, not a
// career: tournament_participants carries elo_before / elo_after / elo_change /
// points / final_position per entrant per event, and elo_change accumulates
// across the event's rounds (00083) while elo_after tracks the ladder, so the
// pair of them is a true "where they started, where they are now" for the day.
//
// A SEPARATE ACTION rather than a wider return from enterMatchResult. Those
// signatures are ActionResult<void> and are asserted against by a great deal of
// test, and the summary is a READ — it has no business sharing a transaction
// with the write, and it must run AFTER the write has landed to report anything
// true. Gated on `tournaments.page`, the same capability that renders the event
// page: the Results and Leaderboard tabs already show these columns to anyone
// who can open it, so this exposes nothing new.
//
// DOUBLES IS THINNER, AND SAYS SO. tournament_pairs has combined_elo, points and
// final_position and no per-event rating columns at all — there is no pair row
// for a rating to move on, and the deltas go to the two players' ladders
// individually. So a doubles summary reports the record and the points and
// leaves the rating line off rather than printing a blank one.
