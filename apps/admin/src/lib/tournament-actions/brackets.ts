/**
 * A BYE IS NOT A RESULT, and counting it as one made the draw unregenerable the
 * instant it was drawn.
 *
 * Generation writes `status: 'completed'` onto every bye it creates (see the
 * round-one loop below) because a bye has already been decided — its winner
 * advances with nothing to play. The guard then read those rows back as entered
 * results, so ANY field that is not a power of two produced a draw that answered
 * "Results have already been entered — void those matches first" about matches
 * that have no score, no Elo and no opponent to void.
 *
 * It went unnoticed because generation was reachable exactly once: the button
 * lived at `checkin` and the first press moved the event to `bracket_generated`,
 * out of the button's reach. Three of the four staging events sitting at
 * `bracket_generated` today have byes and no other completed match, so a
 * Regenerate control would have refused on three out of four.
 *
 * `NOT (is_bye IS TRUE)` and not `is_bye <> true`, because the column is
 * nullable (00001: `BOOLEAN DEFAULT false`) and under SQL's three-valued logic
 * `<>` is UNKNOWN against NULL — a `.neq` would have dropped every NULL row as
 * well, quietly excluding real matches and leaving the guard permanently
 * satisfied. `IS TRUE` is null-safe: true -> false, false -> true, null -> true.
 *
 * A walkover is still a result and still blocks: it is rated, and the go-live
 * sweep records real ones (setEventStatus -> forfeitOutOfEventEntries).
 *
 * (The `IS TRUE` half is now expressed by isPlayedMatch in packages/shared
 * rather than by a PostgREST filter, but the reasoning is unchanged and the
 * SQL side of it lives on in 00144, which has to spell it out again.)
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * THIS IS THE EARLY, FRIENDLY REFUSAL. IT IS NOT THE GUARANTEE.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * It runs before generation does any work, so an exec who cannot redraw is told
 * so in one round trip instead of after 40. But it is a READ, and the DELETE it
 * protects is issued dozens of round trips later — on a 32-entry draw, several
 * seconds later. Anything that lands in that window is invisible to it.
 *
 * The guarantee lives in the database: delete_phase_matches (00144) re-asks
 * these same three questions of the rows the DELETE actually removed, in the
 * same statement, and rolls the delete back. That is what makes a redraw safe.
 * This function makes it POLITE. If the two ever disagree, the RPC is right.
 *
 * THREE THINGS BLOCK A REDRAW and they are not one condition — see
 * summariseRedrawBlockers in packages/shared for the reasoning behind each.
 * Briefly: a result cannot be rebuilt over; an unreversed rating on the row is
 * the only record of what it did to the ladder; and a live match has people on
 * court.

/**

 *     .update({ status: 'bracket_generated', ... })
 *
 * which was invisible while the only caller was the check-in press — the event
 * was AT check-in, so writing `bracket_generated` was the forward step. The
 * moment a redraw is reachable from a running event it stops being a forward
 * step and becomes the only write in the whole console that sends an event
 * BACKWARDS: the header's primary button would revert from "Finalize
 * Tournament" to "Start Tournament", the players' app would stop showing the
 * event as under way, and pressing Start again would re-run the go-live
 * forfeit sweep. setEventStatus's transition table is deliberately forward-only
 * (registration -> checkin -> bracket_generated -> live -> completed) precisely
 * so that cannot happen, and this would have gone around it silently.
 *
 * REDRAWING IS NOT A STATUS CHANGE. It replaces the matches; it does not
 * un-start the event. A live event stays live.
 *
 * `completed` is not handled here because assertNotFinalised has already
 * refused it, and no other status can reach a generator with a draw to replace.

/**
 * Delete the matches of ONE phase, leaving the other half alone.
 *
 * The single most destructive line in this module used to be
 * `.delete().eq('event_id', eventId)`, and it was correct while an event had
 * one draw. On a pool-to-bracket event it would take the played-out pool with
 * it every time the knockout was regenerated. `.is('phase', null)` is not used
 * for the other two formats: their matches all carry NULL, so the unfiltered
 * delete is already exactly right and adding a filter would only create a way
 * for a stray row to survive a rebuild — which is why `p_phase` is passed as
 * NULL for them and 00144 reads NULL as "no filter" rather than "phase IS NULL".
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS IS AN RPC AND NOT A DELETE
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Because the DELETE and the check that it was allowed have to be the SAME
 * STATEMENT, and from here they cannot be.
 *
 * assertDrawIsRebuildable runs 40+ sequential PostgREST round trips before this
 * line — the field read, buildFieldFromPool, the seeding computation, one
 * seed_number UPDATE per entrant. A result entered by another exec anywhere in
 * that window is invisible to the guard and fully visible to the delete, and
 * this delete has NO PREDICATE: it takes the match row, and with it the
 * `elo_snapshot` that is the ONLY record of the deltas that match put on the
 * ladder. reverse_tournament_match_rating reads that column; once the row is
 * gone the rating cannot be taken back by any path, and nothing anywhere
 * reports a problem. Exec B is told the result saved. Exec A is told the draw
 * regenerated. Both are true.
 *
 * A PREDICATE ON THE DELETE CANNOT FIX IT: leaving the played match behind and
 * deleting the rest produces an incoherent half-draw. The operation is
 * all-or-nothing, so the invariant is "refuse the whole thing", and that is not
 * something a WHERE clause can say.
 *
 * NOR CAN MOVING THE COUNT INTO THE SAME TRANSACTION. Under READ COMMITTED each
 * statement takes its own snapshot, so a count-then-delete function body loses
 * the same race — narrower, not closed. delete_phase_matches (00144) instead
 * deletes and counts what it deleted in ONE data-modifying CTE and RAISEs,
 * rolling the delete back, if anything in it had a result, carried an unreversed
 * rating, or was being played. Verified by reproducing the loss both ways in a
 * container before the fix and showing it prevented after.
 *
 * The refusals are ExpectedError, not faults: an exec who cannot redraw is the
 * system working. 23514 is the SQLSTATE 00144 raises them under, matching how
 * addPairToEventImpl reads 00102's refusals.

 * Build the knockout's field from THIS EVENT'S OWN pool (00107).
 *
 * THIS IS WHERE THE ONE-EVENT FORMAT IS GENUINELY SIMPLER THAN THE TWO-EVENT
 * ONE, and it is worth being explicit about what disappears. buildFieldFromPool
 * above has to PROMOTE: read the source event, check it belongs to the same
 * tournament, check it is the same discipline, look every finisher up by an
 * order-independent player key, reuse an existing entry or INSERT a new one,
 * carry the rating across, and skip anyone who withdrew from the destination.
 * Every one of those steps exists because the qualifier's row in the bracket is
 * a DIFFERENT ROW from their row in the pool.
 *
 * Here it is the same row. tournament_participants / tournament_pairs are not
 * per-phase; they are per-event, and both phases are this event. So qualifying
 * is writing a seed number onto rows that are already there:
 *
 *   * nothing is inserted, so there is no duplicate-entry failure mode;
 *   * there is no second event, so there is no cross-discipline and no
 *     cross-tournament check to get wrong;
 *   * CHECK-IN HAPPENS ONCE. The two-event path had to stamp checked_in_at onto
 *     the rows it created, because they were new rows that had never checked in
 *     — which is precisely the thing the club owner objected to. Here the
 *     entrant checked in this morning and has been playing ever since.
 *
 * The ORDER is qualificationOrder's when the pool has groups and sortStandings'
 * when it is flat — computeRoundRobinStandings already picks between them — so
 * the seeding tiers the draw shuffles within are the ones 00106 built.

// have it. Three reasons it has to be the exec's call:
//
//   * A 4-entry draw's "semi-finals" are round one. The third-place match is
//     then an immediate rematch between two people who have played exactly one
//     match each, on the same evening, for a placing nobody asked about. Some
//     events want that; a Tuesday social does not.
//   * A draw with byes may not produce two real semi-final losers — a bye has
//     no losing side. Generating the match regardless is right (see
//     advanceLoser), but committing every event to it regardless is not.
//   * Doing it automatically would change the shape of every event that already
//     exists the next time its draw was regenerated, silently.
//
// The choice is NOT stored on tournament_events. The generated match IS the
// record — is_third_place is what finalizeEvent and the bracket read — and a
// second column claiming an event "has" a third-place match could disagree with
// whether one exists. This module's whole defect history is a stored summary
// disagreeing with the rows underneath it.
//
// RATED, like every other match, and that took no code at all: the rating path
// keys off the result, not the round. That is the argument for it. Leaving it
// rated means the players' Elo reflects a real match with a real result, and
// exempting it would mean carving a round-shaped exception into
// applyTournamentMatchElo — which is precisely how a match ends up silently not

  // seed_skip_count is a FLOOR. It does not place a single bye — the byes are
  // already where it wants them. A field of N sits in a bracket of
  // nextPowerOf2(N); the empty slots are the tail ranks; getStandardSeedPositions
  // pairs rank r against rank B+1-r, so the empty tail falls opposite the TOP
  // RANKS and hands them the byes. See 00124's header for the full argument.
  //
  // RANKS, NOT SEEDS, AND THE GAP IS WHY THIS NUMBER IS ALSO PASSED TO THE
  // DRAW. The byes land on ranks 1..B-N; the draw shuffles entrants within
  // their seeding tier, so the entrant AT rank r is only guaranteed to be seed
  // r when the tier boundaries line up with the prefix. They do not in general:
  // a promise of 3 on a 5-strong field sits inside the [3,4] band, and a
  // promise of 9 on a 20-strong field sits inside [9,16] with the bye line at
  // 12 — so seeds 13-16 could take the last four byes while seeds 9-12 played
  // round one. Checking the COUNT of byes here and leaving the draw alone would
  // therefore validate a promise the draw was free to break.
  //
  // So the number goes to the shuffle as well, where it becomes a tier boundary
  // of its own (seedTierBandsReserving), and the check below stays a pure
  // count. One number, read once, enforced in the one place that can enforce
  // it — rather than a second post-draw validator that could disagree with the
  // first.
  //
  // So the number of byes is a function of N alone and nobody can choose it.

  // checked when the number is set — nobody has entered yet — so it is checked
  // here, where N is real.

  //
  // TWO FIELDS ARE NOT DRAWN, and both are somebody having already said where
  // people go:
  //
  //   * seeding_method = 'manual'. An exec who hand-set every seed asked for
  //     the draw those seeds describe, and has to keep getting it. This is the
  //     opt-out, and it is the only one.
  //   * A SINGLE-POOL-seeded event. buildFieldFromPool refuses a half-played
  //     pool precisely so the bracket matches what everyone just played for;
  //     re-drawing the qualifiers would put the pool's third finisher into the
  //     second seed's half on a coin flip, which is the outcome pool seeding
  //     exists to prevent. seeding_method is not even consulted on that path,
  //     so there would be no opt-out to offer.
  //
  // A GROUP-SEEDED EVENT IS THE THIRD CASE, AND IT IS DRAWN (00106).
  //
  // The argument above does not survive the move from one pool to several, and
  // it is worth saying exactly where it breaks. With ONE pool, the finishing
  // order is a total order that everybody played for: 3rd beat 4th, or beat the
  // people 4th lost to, and swapping them would overturn a result. With SEVERAL
  // groups there is no such order between groups. "Winner of A plays runner-up
  // of B" is fixed by the format, but WHICH B is a question the group stage
  // never asked and cannot answer — the groups played disjoint fixtures. Fixing
  // it to whichever group happens to be numbered lowest is not respecting a
  // result, it is inventing one, and it makes the bracket a pure function of
  // the group numbering, which is the "REGENERATE DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING"
  // defect wearing a different hat.
  //
  // So it is drawn — but WITHIN QUALIFICATION TIERS, not within seeding bands.
  // See drawAvoidingSameGroupRound1 for why drawWithinTiers is the wrong
