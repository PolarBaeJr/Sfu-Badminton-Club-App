// "REGENERATE DRAW DOESNT CHANGE ANYTHING", and it followed from the design.
// Placement is a pure function of the sorted field against
// getStandardSeedPositions, so the same entrants with the same seeds always
// produced a byte-identical bracket. Pressing the button twice was a no-op the
// exec had no way to tell apart from a bug.
//
// The answer is the one real tournaments use: the seeds are not POSITIONS, they
// are TIERS, and the draw is made at random within each tier.
//
//   * Seeds 1 and 2 go to opposite ends. Fixed, never drawn.
//   * Seeds 3-4 are drawn into the two remaining half-brackets, one each.
//   * Seeds 5-8 into the four remaining quarters, one each.
//   * 9-16 into the eighths, and so on — every band is a power of two.
//   * Everyone below the last full band is, in effect, unseeded: they are one
//     large band and are drawn at random into whatever is left.
//
// The invariant that survives is the entire reason seeding exists: two entrants
// of the same tier can never meet before the round their tier implies. Seeds 1
// and 2 not before the final, 1-4 not before the semis, 1-8 not before the
// quarters.
//
// WHY THIS IS SAFE, stated as the argument rather than as a hope. The bands are
// exactly [1,1], [2,2], [3,4], [5,8], [9,16] ..., so the union of every band up
// to and including [2^(k-1)+1, 2^k] is precisely {1..2^k}. Permuting within
// bands therefore maps {1..2^k} onto itself for every k. getStandardSeedPositions
// already places ranks 1..2^k one per sub-bracket of size B/2^k; a permutation
// of that set can only ever reshuffle which of those sub-brackets each one gets,
// never put two of them in the same one. The separation is preserved by
// construction, not by luck — and draw-randomisation.test.ts proves it over
// thousands of draws anyway.

 * RANKS: they fall on ranks 1..B-E, and drawWithinTiers is free to move an
 * entrant anywhere inside their band. When the promised prefix ends in the
 * MIDDLE of a band, those two facts disagree. A 5-entry field has 3 byes and
 * bands [1,1], [2,2], [3,4], so a promise of 3 is accepted by the generator's
 * ceiling check and then broken by the draw half the time: seed 4 takes rank 3
 * and its bye while seed 3 plays round one. A 20-entry field is the version the
 * club will actually see — 12 byes, band [9,16] straddling the bye line, so a
 * promise of 9 can leave four promised seeds playing round one.
 *
 * The fix is to say what the promise means: an exec who typed a number has
 * declared that the top N are NOT interchangeable with the rest of their tier,
 * so the draw treats N as a tier boundary of its own.
 *
 * THIS CANNOT BREAK THE SEPARATION INVARIANT, and the argument is the same one
 * the band comment above makes. Separation survives because permuting within a
 * band maps {1..2^k} onto itself for every k; cutting a band into two
 * CONTIGUOUS sub-ranges and shuffling each within itself is still a permutation
 * that maps each band's set onto itself, so it is a strictly smaller group of
 * permutations than the one already proved safe. Nothing can cross a boundary
 * that was not crossable before.

//
// drawWithinTiers shuffles inside the SEEDING bands [1,1], [2,2], [3,4],
// [5,8] ... — the powers of two the bracket's own geometry is built from. Those
// bands are exactly right when the seeding order is a rating order, because
// then the band boundaries are the only thing that separation depends on.
//
// They are WRONG for a group stage, and the failure is not hypothetical.
// Qualification order puts every group WINNER first and every RUNNER-UP after
// them, so with 3 groups of 2 qualifiers the winners hold ranks 1-3 and the
// runners-up 4-6 — while seedTierBands(6) yields [1,1], [2,2], [3,4], [5,6].
// Band [3,4] STRADDLES the boundary: shuffling it can draw a runner-up above a
// group winner, which is precisely the outcome brackets.ts already refuses to
// let a pool-seeded draw produce. Every group count that is not a power of two,
// and every qualifiers-per-group above 2, has the same straddle somewhere.
//
// So the tiers a group-seeded draw is shuffled within are the QUALIFICATION
// tiers — winners among themselves, runners-up among themselves, thirds among
// themselves — and nothing else. That is the coin flip that is genuinely a
// choice: "winner of A plays runner-up of B" is decided by the format, but
// WHICH B is not decided by anything the groups played, so drawing it is more
// honest than fixing it to whichever group happens to be numbered lowest.
//
// drawWithinTiers keeps its exact signature and keeps serving the ordinary
// rating-seeded path, which is what the randomised-draw work built it for.

 * Shuffle within each contiguous run of entries sharing a tier.

 * computed from a band table, so a tier that is short (a group with fewer
 * finishers than the rest) needs no special case: it is simply a shorter run.
 *
 * `reserveTop` is seed_skip_count (00124), and it cuts a run the same way
 * seedTierBandsReserving cuts a band, for the same reason and with the same
 * safety argument — a run split into two contiguous halves still permutes the
 * run's own set onto itself, so no qualifier can cross a tier that they could
 * not cross before. It is needed HERE as well as there because
 * seed_skip_count's CHECK only excludes round_robin: a pool_to_bracket event
 * with two or more groups reaches its knockout through this shuffle, and a
 * promise landing mid-run breaks identically. Two groups with five qualifiers
 * order as [W-A, W-B, R-A, R-B, T-A]: three byes, and a promise of 3 lands
 * inside the runners-up run, so the third bye is a coin flip between R-A and
 * R-B when it was promised to whichever of them the seeding put third.
 *
 * This cuts against the header above — "which B is a question the group stage
 * never asked" — only at the default, which is where that argument lives. An

 *   * A PIGEONHOLE PRE-CHECK. Round one has a fixed number of CONTESTED matches

 *     whose field is mostly one group.
 *   * A BOUNDED ATTEMPT COUNT for everything the pigeonhole cannot see.
 *
 * When neither succeeds the FALLBACK IS THE BEST DRAW SEEN, not a refusal.
 * Refusing would mean an exec cannot generate a knockout at all because of a
 * scheduling nicety, on a day when the courts are already booked. The caller
 * records `same_group_round_1` in the audit row so the compromise is written
 * down rather than merely tolerated.
 *
 * `reserveTop` MAKES 'unavoidable' VERY SLIGHTLY MORE LIKELY, AND THAT IS THE
 * TRADE, stated here so the next person to see `same_group_round_1:
 * 'unavoidable'` on an event that also carries a seed_skip_count does not go
 * looking for a second bug.
 *
 * The reserve never creates a clash by itself — the ranks it pins are bye
 * ranks, and a bye is never a conflict. What it does is shrink the pool the
 * attempt loop can draw from: when the promise ends inside a run that reaches
 * past the bye line, only the members above the promise can still reach the
 * CONTESTED ranks, so an arrangement that needed a now-pinned qualifier down
 * there is no longer reachable and the loop can exhaust where it used to

 * Undo everything a rated tournament match did: each player's Elo delta and

 *
 * The whole reversal is ONE transaction inside
 * reverse_tournament_match_rating (00078). It used to be a batch of PostgREST
 * read-modify-writes here, and that shape carried a defect no amount of care in
 * TypeScript could close: the ratings came off the ladder in one round trip and
 * the REDUCED snapshot went back in another. When the second one failed, the
 * ORIGINAL snapshot survived on a match whose deltas were already gone — so the
 * next void/undo/edit reversed the same entries a second time. Since 00070 the
 * statistics travel with the Elo, so a double reverse also strips a
 * matches_played, a win, and a set of points and games the match never added.
 * The floors at 0 made that quieter, not rarer.
 *
 * That is also why the old partial-reversal machinery is gone rather than
 * ported. Keeping the un-reversed entries on the snapshot and retrying the
 * remainder was the mitigation for a batch that could half-land; nothing can
 * half-land now, so there is never a remainder.
 *
 * Reversing is therefore idempotent: the snapshot is cleared in the same
 * transaction as the deltas, and a match with no snapshot has nothing to undo,
 * so the RPC returns quietly. A retry after an unclear outcome is safe.
 *
 * The statistics half is not optional. editMatchResult reverses the snapshot and
 * then RE-rates the match, so a reversal that left matches_played/wins/points
 * behind would add a second set of counts on every correction; undo and void
 * would leave a result in the statistics that no longer exists.
 *
 * Two figures still cannot be reversed unconditionally, and the SQL handles both:
 *   - best_*_streak is a high-water mark. It is never written on the way back
 *     out, exactly as it is never written on the way in.
 *   - current_*_streak is restored EXACTLY when the match being undone is still
 *     the player's most recent rated one — 00078 stores the streak before and
 *     after, and compares the stored "after" with what is in the row. Before
 *     that, undoing a win by a player who had been on -3 left them on 0 rather
 *     than -3. If a later match has moved the streak since, the old
 *     step-toward-zero applies instead, because rewinding to the stored value
 *     would erase that later match.

// same query and differ only in how the finished table is read.
//
// TWO ORDERS, ONE TALLY (00106). Everything above the final sort is identical
// for a flat round robin and a group stage — the same matches, the same
// withdrawal rule, the same figures — because a group stage IS a round robin
// that happens to be partitioned. Only the last step differs:
//
//   * group_count NULL or 1 -> sortStandings, exactly as before. Not a special
//     case of the group path, and not routed through it: the flat behaviour is
//     the untouched one.
//   * group_count >= 2 -> qualificationOrder, which reads the event as winners,
//     then runners-up, then thirds. Every row also comes back carrying `group`
//     and `groupRank`, which is what lets the bracket generator shuffle within
//     qualification tiers and keep group-mates apart in round one.
//
// WHAT THIS CHANGES FOR A FINALISED GROUP STAGE, stated rather than left to be
// discovered: finalize.ts assigns final_position from this list's order, so a
// group stage's positions become 1..G for the group winners (best record
// first), G+1..2G for the runners-up, and so on. Positions stay UNIQUE — one
// 1st, one 2nd — so the placement-bonus ledger pays exactly the same number of
// people it always did. The alternative, a flat ranking across groups by raw
// wins, is the one that is actually wrong here: it compares records built
