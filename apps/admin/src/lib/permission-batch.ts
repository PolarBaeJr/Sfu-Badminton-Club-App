// QUEUEING PERMISSION CHANGES FOR SEVERAL PEOPLE AND SAVING THEM TOGETHER.
//
// The editor used to hold one person's pending triple in three pieces of state,
// so picking somebody else threw the work away. This is the same triple, keyed
// by person, plus the two things a batch needs that a single save never did: a
// summary across everybody, and an ordering that refuses the whole batch rather
// than half-applying it.
//
// NOTHING HERE DECIDES WHETHER A SAVE IS ALLOWED. localRefusal() mirrors the
// checks setPlayerPermissions makes, so a batch that cannot land is refused
// before any of it is written — but the server resolves the actor's own set from
// the actor's own row and runs every one of those checks again, per call. This
// is the refusal arriving early, never the authority to skip it.
//
// Pure on purpose: the component around it is a thousand lines of tree and the
// parts worth pinning — who is dirty, what the counts add up to, and that a
// single refusal writes nothing — are the parts that do not need a DOM.
