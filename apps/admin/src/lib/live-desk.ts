/**
 * Every match still to be played, in the draw's own sequence.
 *
 * THE ORDER: THE DRAW'S OWN SEQUENCE, AND NOTHING ELSE. This list used to sort
 * uncourted matches first, on the theory that "which matches still need a court"
 * was the working question. In practice the owner's screenshot read "95 of 98
 * unplayed matches have no court yet", which is the sort admitting it does
 * nothing: on any real draw almost everything is uncourted, so the rule never
 * differentiates and its only effect is to hide the sequence the desk actually
 * works in. It was also quietly hostile: saving a court moved that row from the
 * top group to the bottom one, so the reward for typing "3" was watching the row
 * you were looking at jump off screen.
 *
 * So: phase, then round, then match number. Nothing about a match's STATE touches
 * the order, which means no row ever moves under the desk's hands: not when a
 * court is saved, not when someone is marked ready, not when a result lands
 * elsewhere and the whole list repaints. That is the property that makes the
 * Court Management tab safe to type into.
 *
 * PHASE OUTRANKS ROUND, and it has to (00107). The desk is given the whole event
 * rather than one half of it, because matches from both halves of a
 * pool_to_bracket event are called out of one queue, but `round_number` restarts
 * at 1 in the bracket, so ordering on it alone would interleave a pool round 1
 * with a quarter-final.
 *
 * MATCH NUMBER RATHER THAN bracket_position, because the number is what the desk
 * and the entrant both say out loud: the row prints "ROUND OF 128 · M4" and M4 is
 * the ordinal in that round. bracket_position is the layout's coordinate and can
 * differ. It falls back to bracket_position where match_number is null, which is
 * how a draw generated before 00080's renumbering still sorts sanely.

 *
 * A `live` MATCH DOES NOT OUTRANK IT: it is excluded. "Next" means the one to
 * send on now, and a match already being played is not something you call; it is
 * something you wait for. Live matches carry their own ON COURT badge and are
 * counted separately, which is the fact the desk needs from them (how many
 * courts are busy).
 *
 * TBD IS NOT CALLABLE. A round-of-64 slot fed by unplayed round-of-128 matches
 * has no names in it, so however many courts are free it cannot be sent
 * anywhere. Those rows say what they are waiting for instead.
 *
 * ONE, THOUGH SEVERAL COURTS RUN AT ONCE, and the owner's "next one" is right
 * even though his need is plural. Several matches genuinely ARE callable: on a
 * fresh round of 128, all 64 of them. Badging 64 rows "callable now" would be
 * badging the whole list, which is not information. And the app CANNOT compute
 * "the next four", because nothing in this schema knows how many courts the club
 * has: `sessions` has no court column and nothing else counts them, which is
 * written down in two places already (admin dashboard/page.tsx, sessions/page.tsx).
 *
 * What makes one badge sufficient is the ordering above: the rows immediately
 * BELOW the one marked NEXT are, by construction, the ones after next. The desk
 * reads down. That is the whole reason ordering by the draw's own sequence and
 * marking a single next are the same feature rather than two.
