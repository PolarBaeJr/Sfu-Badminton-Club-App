// THE REST OF THE EXEC'S OWN WORDS, AND WHO MAY SEE THEM.
//
// The sibling of lib/match-note.ts, which did this for `matches.admin_note`
// under migration 00117. That was the first such column looked at, not the only
// one. 00118 moves the four that remained:
//
//   tournament_participants.notes  withdrawal / DQ reason for a singles entry
//   tournament_pairs.notes         the same, for a doubles entry
//   tournament_matches.notes       void / double-no-show / restore reason
//   walkovers.admin_notes          the reason a walkover was confirmed/rejected
//
// ONE MODULE, NOT FOUR. match-note.ts is shaped around a single table and reads
// well for it; four copies of it would be four places for the missing-table
// predicate and the "who may read" rule to drift apart. What differs per table
// is data — the table name, the key column, the capabilities — so it is held as
// data, and the three functions below are shared.
//
// WHY NOT FOLD match-note.ts IN HERE TOO. It is reachable from /matches, this
// module is reachable from /tournaments, /walkovers and /players, and merging
// them would make every one of those pages import the others' constants for
// nothing. The one thing that genuinely must not be duplicated — the
// missing-table predicate — is shared instead: match-note.ts's
// isMissingNoteTableError now delegates to isMissingTableError below.

import { permits, type AccessLevel, type Capability, type Permissions } from './permissions';
// Deep path, not the barrel, for the same reason the type-only import below is
// type-only: this module is unit-tested without a request, and the barrel drags
// in the email sender and its Resend/Supabase clients. query-chunks is pure.
import { selectInChunks } from '@badminton/shared/src/utils/query-chunks';
// TYPE-ONLY, and it has to stay that way — the same constraint match-note.ts
// documents. supabase-server.ts reaches for next/headers and the passkey cookie
// machinery at import time; a value import here would drag all of it into the
// unit tests, which have no request to read cookies from. `import type` is
// erased entirely.

/**
 * "PostgREST/Postgres has never heard of this table."
 *
 * Lifted out of match-note.ts so both modules answer it the same way, and
 * PARAMETERISED ON THE TABLE NAME, which is the one line that could not simply
 * be imported: the original's message backstop reads
 * `message.includes(MATCH_ADMIN_NOTE_TABLE)`, so importing it unchanged would
 * have silently failed the codeless-error case for all four tables here — the
 * exact kind of near-miss reuse that is worse than duplication.
 *
 * THIS IS A DIFFERENT FAMILY FROM 00116's, and copying that predicate would
 * miss it. `isUnknownColumnError` in lib/actions/sessions.ts swallows PGRST204
 * and 42703 — a missing COLUMN on a table that exists. Here the whole TABLE is
 * absent, which PostgREST answers out of its schema cache as PGRST205, or as
 * PGRST202 on a client whose reader predates that code, and which Postgres
 * itself raises as 42P01 (undefined_table) if the statement gets past the cache.
 *
 * EVERYTHING ELSE IS THE CALLER'S PROBLEM, and that is the point of naming
 * codes at all. A blanket catch would mean that once 00118 is applied a genuine
 * failure — a constraint, a connection, a permission — still ends in a green
 * toast, and the exec walks away believing a reason was recorded that was not.

 * `throw` would. A note is advisory; the audit row is not, so the catch is

 * than quietly as "not recorded".

 * AN EMPTY NOTE DELETES THE ROW rather than storing ''. The columns being
 * replaced were nullable and two of the call sites wrote `reason ?? null` and
 * `reason || null` — clearing was reachable and meant "there is no longer a
 * reason here". A row whose `note` is NOT NULL cannot represent that, so the
 * absence of a row does, which is the same convention 00117 chose ("no note is
 * the absence of a row").
