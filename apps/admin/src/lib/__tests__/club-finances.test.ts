// Four things can go wrong with a money action and every one of them is silent
// in production, so each is pinned here:
//   1. someone writes to a ledger they are not allowed to write to — which is
//      now a per-ACTION question, not a per-file one: an exec may add an
//      expense and may do nothing else here;
//   2. a delete or an update "succeeds" against a row that was not there,
//      because PostgREST reports "matched no rows" as success;
//   3. money moves with nobody's name attached, because the audit write was
//      forgotten or was given the destroyed row too late to record it;
//   4. the wrong person is recorded as being owed money, because the payer was
//      taken from whoever typed the row instead of being asked for.
