// MARKING A FEE PAID MUST NOT SILENTLY REWRITE A PAYMENT THAT WAS ALREADY TAKEN.
//
// waiveFee has a long comment about this and a guard to match: it names a
// fee_waived row on production whose old_value is empty, because the write
// replaced a real amount with $0 and the audit entry kept no copy of what had
// been there. The two mark-paid actions were the same defect and had neither
// half of the fix:
//
//   * they read the existing row's `id` alone, updated amount_cents / method /
//     reference / tier_id unconditionally, and audited with no old_value — so a
//     $100 dues row rewritten as $80, or a $25 door price rewritten as the $15
//     member tier, lost the original figure in the ledger AND in the log;
//   * the UPDATE carried no predicate, so two desks working the same roster both
//     read an unpaid row and the second write landed on top of the first.
//
// Both are covered here for BOTH ledgers — club dues (actions/fees.ts) and
// tournament entry fees (actions/tournament-fees.ts) — because they are the same
// three lines over the same table and only the tournament one was reported.
//
// The assertions are on the SURVIVING ROW and on the audit entry, not on "it
// threw": the point is never to lose the number, and a refusal that still
// overwrote would pass a throw-only test.
//
// THREE MORE OF THE SAME SHAPE, covered here because they were found while the
// two fee ledgers were about to grow bulk (multi-select) bars. A bulk bar is a
// LOOP over the single-record action, which makes "the caller omitted the
// optional arguments, over a selection that has gone stale" the ordinary case
// rather than the odd one:
//
//   * waiveFee permitted a re-waive, calling it idempotent. It is not: the write
//     sets a fresh paid_at and marked_by, so a second waive destroys the date the
//     waiver was granted and the officer who granted it.
//   * markFeeUnpaid reported a member with no dues row as a Sentry FAULT, and it
//     "reversed" an already-unpaid row — clearing three already-null fields,
//     reporting success, and filing a fee_marked_unpaid audit entry for a
//     reversal that reversed nothing.
//   * markTournamentFeePaid derived the amount BEFORE reading the existing row,
//     so a call naming neither a tier nor an amount re-priced that row from the
//     tournament's default tier. ensureEntryFees seeds those rows from the
//     member's REAL tier, so a $25 external snapshot came back as the $15 default
//     with nothing anywhere to show it had changed.
//
// Two of the three were unreachable from a rendered control, which is why they
// survived. The third was reachable narrowly: the Amount field is optional, so
// clearing it on a row carrying no tier_id sent neither field. Every one of them
// is reachable from a loop.
