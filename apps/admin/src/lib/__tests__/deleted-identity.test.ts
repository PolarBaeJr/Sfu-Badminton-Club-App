// FIX-LIST #17 — "deletion leaves identity in four places".
//
// The four are: auth.audit_log_entries (730 prod rows carrying the real email
// in payload.actor_username), public.audit_logs.old_value (26 prod rows holding
// an address), the deletion_requested_at tombstone, and free text nobody swept.
// The first is `auth`-schema and unreachable from the app — migration 00155
// hands it over. The tombstone is deliberately kept and the purge job says why.
// This file covers the two halves that ARE app code:
//
//   1. The purge jobs' anonymising field list, which had been missing
//      `exec_photo_url` and `handle` — a photo of the person and the one name
//      they chose, both public, both promised erased.
//   2. The four admin actions that wrote a whole `select('*')` player row into
//      a permanent audit table.
//
// The pinning tests are the point. Both halves failed the same way — a list
// maintained by hand fell behind the table it describes — so the tests check
// the lists against the table rather than against a fixture.
