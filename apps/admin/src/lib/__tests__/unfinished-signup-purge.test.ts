// purge-unfinished-signups (00233) is the only job in the repo that DELETES a
// players row. Its twin purge-inactive-accounts anonymises, and both of the
// existing jobs therefore end with an UPDATE that leaves a partial failure
// retryable. This one cannot, so two of its decisions are inverted from the
// files a future editor will read first, and both look like bugs:
//
//   1. It deletes the players row BEFORE the auth user. Doing it the other way
//      round fires players.user_id ON DELETE SET NULL (00001:152), which makes
//      the stub byte-identical to an unclaimed exec pre-add, permanently
//      invisible to the view's `user_id IS NOT NULL` arm and to every future
//      run. "Make it match the other two" is the natural review comment and it
//      would strand rows unrecoverably.
//   2. Its dry-run gate is PURGE_UNFINISHED_ENABLED, not the existing
//      PURGE_INACTIVE_ENABLED. Reusing the older one would mean arming
//      anonymisation of lapsed members also armed outright deletion here, in
//      one keystroke, invisibly.
//
// Source-text pins, the same technique deleted-identity.test.ts:86-98 uses,
// because nothing here can be exercised without a Deno runtime and a service
// key. COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED FIRST: this file's own subject matter is prose
// about `auth.admin.deleteUser` and `PURGE_INACTIVE_ENABLED`, and the function's
// header is required to discuss both. Asserting against raw source would make
// the header's explanation fail the test that protects it, and the natural fix
// for that is to weaken the assertion.
