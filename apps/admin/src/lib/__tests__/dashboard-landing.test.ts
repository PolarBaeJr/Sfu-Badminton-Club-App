// WHO LANDS ON A BARE DASHBOARD, and what they are shown instead.
//
// The dashboard's panels are gated one capability at a time, which is correct
// and is not what this file is about: it is about the person for whom EVERY one
// of those answers is no. She holds fees.page, fees.expenses.read and
// fees.expenses.add.write — the Finance role — and no panel on the page asks
// for any of them, so she used to get a header and an empty screen, which looks
// exactly like the app being broken.
//
// TWO THINGS ARE PINNED HERE. First, that the narrowed branch is UNREACHABLE
// for anybody nobody narrowed: an unrestricted exec holds fees.expenses.read
// (it is in EXEC_BASELINE, and ROLE_DEFAULTS.finance is precisely that subset of
// it), so no capability separates the Finance role from an ordinary exec inside
// the fees area, and the new tiles can only be conditioned on the old ones being
// absent. Second, that the signpost is DERIVED — it enumerates the sections
// through the same canAccess() the sidebar and the middleware use, so a section
// added later appears in it with nothing to remember.
//
// TILE_GATES IS A HAND WRITE-DOWN of the flags at the top of dashboard/page.tsx,
// deliberately, in the same spirit as ./capability-equivalence.test.ts: deriving
// it from the page would make it pass by construction, and the page cannot be
// imported anyway. A panel added there needs its capability added here.
//
// IT MUST BE KEPT IN STEP IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. A gate added to the page and not
// here lets a narrowed person fall into the signpost branch AND render a panel;
// a gate left here after its panel is deleted gives them hasTiles with nothing
// behind it, which is the blank screen the branch exists to prevent.
