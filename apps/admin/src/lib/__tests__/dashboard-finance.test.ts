// WHICH LEDGERS ARE ACTUALLY QUERIED, per capability.
//
// The rule the money pages follow is that a hidden card whose query still ran
// has already shipped the figure — so "gated" has to mean the fetch, not the
// JSX. That claim is untestable while the mapping lives inline in a server
// component, so it lives in one function and this file asserts the only thing
// worth asserting about it: WHICH TABLES WERE TOUCHED.
//
// The tables named below are the club's separate books. Someone holding
// fees.expenses.read may see what the club has spent and nothing about what it
// has taken in, so club_fees, the income half of club_ledger, tournament_fees and
// reinstatement_fees must not be read on their behalf at all — and it is the
// composite helpers (getSeasonFinances, getSeasonIncome) that would read them,
// which is why the per-ledger entry points exist.
//
// `seasons` NO LONGER APPEARS IN THESE LISTS, and that is the point rather than
// a relaxation: the dashboard reads the active season once at the top of the
// page for the header eyebrow, and this function was selecting it a second time.
// It is handed in now. Every claim below about which BOOKS are opened is
// unchanged — the only table that left the assertions is the one that stopped
// being fetched.

/**
 * A Supabase stand-in that records every BOOK opened.
 *
 * A book is no longer the same thing as a table. 00159 put income and expenses
 * in one `club_ledger`, so "which books did this fetch open" — the only
 * question this file asks — is now answered by the table AND the `direction`
 * filter together. Recording the table alone would report a fetch for somebody
 * who may see expenses and no income as having opened the same book as one who
 * may see both, and every assertion here would go quietly green while the leak
 * it guards against was reintroduced.
 *
 * So a club_ledger read is recorded as `club_ledger:<direction>`, and a read
 * that applies no direction is recorded as `club_ledger:UNFILTERED` — which no
 * assertion below permits, so forgetting the filter fails rather than passing
 * under a name that looks close enough.
