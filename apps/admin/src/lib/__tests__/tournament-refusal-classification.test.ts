// A source-level test, deliberately, because the alternative is standing up a
// mock Supabase for twenty actions to assert one word in each. The classification
// IS the thing at risk here: nothing about `throw new Error('Event is full')`
// looks wrong, it type-checks, it reaches the user correctly, and the only
// consequence is a Sentry issue nobody asked for.
//
// It reads both ways on purpose. The refusal list must stay marked so the four
// tournament routes stay quiet; the FAULT list must stay unmarked, and that is
// the assertion that matters — the "Could not check ... try again" family is a
// failed DB read, and 'Event not found' under RLS is indistinguishable from a
// row the caller cannot see, which expected-error.ts already argues has to stay
// loud (the 00032 fallout).
