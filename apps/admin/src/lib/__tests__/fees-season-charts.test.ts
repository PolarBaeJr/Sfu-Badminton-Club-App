/**
 * THE CHART PANELS ON /fees AND /seasons, RENDERED.
 *
 * The maths under them is already pinned by charts.test.ts; what is pinned here
 * is the half a pure-function test cannot reach — WHICH BRANCH a panel takes for
 * a given ledger, and therefore what a reader is actually told. Every panel here
 * has an honest-empty-state path, and an empty state that silently stopped
 * rendering, or a shape drawn over nothing, is exactly the failure the kit's
 * refusals exist to prevent: a null scale that quietly rendered no note at all
 * would pass every assertion in charts.test.ts.
 *
 * THE FIXTURES ARE STAGING'S ACTUAL SHAPE, read off the database on 2026-08-11
 * and transcribed rather than invented, because the degenerate cases there are
 * ones a real club produces: a ledger whose money is dated OUTSIDE its own
 * season's window, an income ledger holding exactly the two days a line needs,
 * an expense ledger with an unpaid row in it, and — on /seasons — a club every
 * one of whose seasons is still ahead of the calendar.
 *
 * createElement RATHER THAN JSX, and a .ts rather than a .tsx: the admin
 * vitest config sets no JSX transform, and turning one on for one test file
 * would change how every other test in this app is compiled. These are server
 * components with no state and no effects, so renderToStaticMarkup drives them
 * exactly as a request would.
