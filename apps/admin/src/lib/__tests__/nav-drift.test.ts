// THE NAV WAS THE ONE HAND-WRITTEN LIST WITH NOTHING HOLDING IT TO THE
// VOCABULARY.
//
// canAccess() sends a path nobody claimed to the admin-only default, which is
// the right failure for a NEW section — but for a MISTYPED href it means the
// link silently disappears for every exec and trainer, with nothing failing
// anywhere. A section renamed on one side and not the other does the same
// thing. There was no test that could catch either, because the sidebar cannot
// be imported: it pulls in next/navigation and a browser Supabase client.
//
// So the list moved into a module with no framework import, each item carries
// the area its href belongs to, and this suite checks that the key and
// canAccess() agree. A nav item is either a BASELINE path — the two links every
// console user keeps, which have no area — or a path under exactly one area.
// There is deliberately no third case: an item that reached the admin-only
// fallthrough would be a link only admins can see, and that is a decision to
// make out loud in the section map, not a side effect of a typo.
