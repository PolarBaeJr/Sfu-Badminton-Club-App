// season-income.ts that sums club_fees AND keeps either old branch counts every
// entry fee and every reinstatement TWICE, and the result is a plausible-looking
// number that overstates the club's income.
//
// A numeric assertion would not catch it — it would just start failing with a
// number somebody could "fix" by editing the expectation. So the mock refuses
// to serve these tables at all. Any residual read is an exception with the
// table's name in it, which is a failure nobody can misread.

// separating three ledgers that share a table. A chain that never filters on

// that rather than hiding it: no filter means the whole table comes back.
