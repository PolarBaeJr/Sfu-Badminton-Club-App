// Which buttons a roster row shows, decided by the tab you are looking at.
//
// The list used to show Edit / Ban / Remove on every tab, which is how an
// INACTIVE account ended up with no way back and a SUSPENDED one was offered
// "Ban". The club owner asked for the actions to match the tab instead:
//
//   Inactive        Edit, Restore
//   Suspended       Edit, Unban
//   Needs attention Edit, Recreational, Competitive
//   Recreational    Edit, Ban, Inactive
//   Competitive     Edit, Ban, Inactive
//
// Three columns are being conflated whenever this gets it wrong, so keep them
// apart:
//
//   is_banned    set by banPlayer, cleared by reinstatePlayer. "Unban".
//   status       competitive | recreational | suspended | pending_approval.
//   active_flag  "inactive". Cleared by removePlayer and nightly by the
//                mark-inactive-players edge function. NOT a status value.
//
// A pure function, deliberately: it is the one part of this feature that can be
// checked without a database, a browser or a session.
