// payload is supplied, a best-effort web push to the same players. Both are
// best-effort: a failure in either channel is reported to Sentry but never
// throws, so the parent admin action still succeeds. Uses the service-role
// admin client because notifications RLS blocks inserting rows for other
// players and push_subscriptions RLS only lets a player read their own rows.
//
// Returns WHO WAS ACTUALLY REACHED, which is not the same as who was asked for
// (F-018). Swallowing the insert error keeps the parent action succeeding —
// that is the point — but a caller that then records "reminded 40 people"
// because it passed 40 ids is reporting an intention as an outcome, and the
// session-reminder job used that number to stamp a permanent per-player
// receipt. `delivered` is empty when the notification rows did not commit.
//
// Delivery means the in-app row, not the push. Push is fire-and-forget by
// design and a member with no subscription is not a failure; the bell is the
// channel that always works and the one that makes a reminder recoverable.
