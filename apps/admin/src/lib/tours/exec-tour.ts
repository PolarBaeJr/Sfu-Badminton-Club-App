// THE EXEC TOUR, as data. Its own module with no framework import so a test
// can read it: the host component (components/exec-tour-host.tsx) pulls in
// next/navigation.
//
// IT VISITS EACH PAGE. A step's href is the page it is shown on, and the tour
// opens it through the router; the target is something on that page. A step
// whose page redirects the reader away, or whose target never appears, is
// skipped, so each step's `requires` must match what its page actually renders
// (exec-tour.test.ts checks that the reader can open every href).
//
// Each step names the capability that makes it true for the reader. What an
// officer holds varies with their role and grants (access-level.ts), so an
// officer who cannot approve signups is never told how to. Two steps also have
// a sentence that depends on a second capability (bulk session edits, the
// Discord cross-post), which is why the steps are built from what the reader
// holds rather than declared once.
//
// Deep imports, not the package barrels: a test loads this file.
