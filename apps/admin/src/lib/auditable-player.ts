// What an audit row is allowed to remember about a person.
//
// FIX-LIST #17. Four admin actions read the whole player row (`select('*')`)
// and then wrote it straight into `audit_logs.old_value`:
// approvePlayer, updatePlayer and removePlayer (actions/players.ts) and
// setPlayerAccessLevel (actions/permissions.ts). `audit_logs` is permanent by
// design — 00139 made it survive the deletion of the player it is about — so
// every one of those rows is a copy of the member's email address, phone
// number, photo URL and bio, sitting in a table that the purge job does not and
// should not empty. 26 rows on production already hold an address.
//
// That is not a hypothetical: the deletion email promises, in these words, that
// "your name, email address, phone number, profile photo and bio are erased for
// good". Anonymising `players` while a full copy of the row survives in
// `audit_logs` does not keep that promise, it just moves where it is kept.
//
// WHY AN ALLOWLIST, AND WHY NOT AT THE CHOKEPOINT. logAdminAudit takes
// `old_value?: unknown` and is called with sessions, announcements, seasons and
// platform settings as well as players. A redactor there would have to guess
// from key names which values are people — and would silently gut an audit row
// for an announcement that happened to carry an organiser's address. So the
// redaction is here, applied by name at the four sites that pass a player row,
// and a value only goes through it because the caller said it was a player.
//
// The list is an ALLOWLIST because the failure modes are not symmetric. A
// denylist that misses a new identity column leaks it silently and forever; an
// allowlist that misses a new moderation column leaves a key out of an audit
// row, which is visible the first time anyone reads one. Neither is free, and
// the test next door removes most of the cost of both: it checks these two
// lists against every column `players` actually has, so a new column fails a
// test until somebody classifies it.
