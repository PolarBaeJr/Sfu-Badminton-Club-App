// HOW THE AUDIT TRAIL BECOMES A FILE. Pure, React-free and framework-free, the
// same discipline ./audit-log-view.ts keeps and for the same reason: every
// function here is a claim about what a downloaded CSV says, and a claim about
// a file is only checkable if it can be made without a request, a database or a
// browser. ./__tests__/audit-export.test.ts is where the claims are checked.
//
// FOUR SOURCES, ONE SHAPE. `public.audit_logs` (what an officer did in the
// console), the GoTrue sign-in log through the 00257 function,
// `public.tournament_audit_log` and `public.notifications`. They are four
// different tables with four different vocabularies, and the reader wants one
// spreadsheet they can sort by time. So each one is mapped onto the same fixed
// column list, every mapper emits the SAME NUMBER OF CELLS, and the columns
// that do not apply to a source are empty rather than absent. A ragged row is
// silent corruption in a CSV: every cell after the short one shifts a column
// left, and nothing anywhere reports it.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// `old_value` AND `new_value` ARE NOT EXPORTED, UNDER ANY FLAG
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// They are the only two columns of `audit_logs` this file deliberately refuses,
// and there is no parameter that turns them on. Four admin actions read the
// whole player row with select('*') and wrote it into `old_value`, so those
// columns hold complete member records: first_name, last_name, full_name,
// display_name, handle, email, phone, avatar_url, exec_photo_url, bio,
// exec_bio, user_id and notification_preferences. That list is not a guess, it
// is the exact key list `public.strip_identity_keys` removes in
// 00155_deletion_reaches_the_audit_trails.sql, written because those two
// columns were the place a deleted member's email address survived the promise
// that it had been erased. Putting them in a file any exec can download, mail
// on and keep would be the single worst thing this feature could do, and it
// would undo 00155 without touching it.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// ONE CLOCK
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every timestamp in the file goes through formatClubTimestamp below, including
// the sign-in rows, which is why the 00257 function returns a raw timestamptz
// rather than the pre-formatted local string the script it came from produces.
// Postgres tzdata and Node ICU tzdata can disagree about Vancouver after
// 2026-11-01, when British Columbia stops falling back, and two clocks in one
// document would put rows an hour apart in the same column with nothing to
// explain it.

// Deep paths, not the barrel: this module is unit-tested without a request, and
// '@badminton/shared' re-exports the mail sender with its Resend and Supabase
// clients attached. Same reason ./private-notes.ts imports query-chunks by
// path.
