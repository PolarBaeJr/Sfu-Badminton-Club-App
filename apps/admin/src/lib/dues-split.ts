/**
 * THE SEASON'S DUES, DIVIDED: what the club collected, what SFU Rec collected,
 * and what is still owed.
 *
 * Drawn twice (the Collection panel on /fees and the Season dues panel on the
 * dashboard), so the division lives here once and both call it.
 *
 * SFU REC IS ITS OWN SEGMENT, NOT A SHRUNKEN "COLLECTED". A member who paid on
 * the SFU Rec website is paid; only the money went to SFU Rec rather than to the
 * club (see lib/season-income.ts). Leaving that money out of the split entirely
 * would shrink the billable total by it and make the term look further along
 * than it is; folding it into Collected would put money the club never held
 * back into the club's figure. A third segment keeps both honest: the three
 * still add up to the billable total, and Collected is the club's money only.
 *
 * The segment appears only when there is SFU Rec money, so a club that never
 * uses it sees the same two-part split as before.
 *
 * `paidPct` is the share of billable dues that is PAID, by either route. It is
 * what "X% of the term's dues are in" means to the person reading it: an
 * SFU Rec payer is not still owed.
