/**
 * HOW MUCH SEASON MONEY IS STILL OWED, IN CENTS.
 *
 * The dashboard's "fees outstanding" cell is an AMOUNT; /fees shows a COUNT of
 * people. They are two readings of one ledger, so the predicate that decides
 * whether a person still owes lives here, in a module with a test on it, rather
 * than a second time inside a page component that nothing can render in a unit
 * test. season-income.ts sets that norm and says why: a total assembled by a
 * page that only remembered some of the rules is how the income figure came to
 * be wrong the first time.
 *
 * WHO IS BILLABLE is transcribed from fees/page.tsx and must stay identical to
 * it: active competitive/recreational members who are neither exec nor
 * fee-exempt. A dashboard that counted a different population would print a
 * figure that contradicts the page it links to.
 *
 * WHAT THEY OWE is the flat per-status fee on the season row. Those two columns
 * are the club's PRICE LIST, and reading them is the caller's decision, not
 * this function's — see the note on BillableSeason.
 *
 * PAID AND WAIVED BOTH SETTLE. A waiver is stored as a paid row with
 * amount_cents 0 and method 'waived' (fee-status.ts), so both carry `paid_at`;
 * the predicate is written out in the same two halves fees/page.tsx uses so
 * that a change to what "waived" means reaches both through the shared helper.
 */

/**
 * The season, WITH its price list.
 *
 * `competitive_fee_cents` / `recreational_fee_cents` are the club's prices, and
 * a sibling agent found /fees shipping them to anybody who could read the
 * expense ledger. They are not page furniture: the caller must have selected
 * them under `fees.clubfees.read` and no weaker gate.

/**
 * WHAT IS STILL OWED, OVER A ROSTER AND A FEE MAP ALREADY IN HAND.
 *
 * The predicate lives here rather than at either call site because there are
 * now two of them and they must never drift: the dashboard fetches the roster
 * and the ledger for this figure alone, while /fees is already holding both —
 * it builds exactly this roster and exactly this `feeByPlayer` map to render
 * the fee table — so its collection chart can reach the same number with no
 * query at all. Two screens, one sum, no second read.
 *
 * PAID AND WAIVED BOTH SETTLE, through the shared isWaivedFee predicate. A
 * waiver is a paid row with amount_cents 0 and method 'waived', so a test that
 * looked only at the amount would bill somebody the club has already excused.
 *
 * WHO IS BILLABLE IS THE CALLER'S QUESTION, not this function's — it sums
 * whatever roster it is given. Both callers filter it the same way (active
 * competitive/recreational, not exec, not fee-exempt), and a caller that
 * filtered differently would be printing a figure about a different club.
