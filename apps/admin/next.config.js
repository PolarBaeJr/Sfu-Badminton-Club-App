  // origin. It used to have a subdomain, but the player app is an installed
  // PWA, and a PWA cannot keep a cross-origin navigation in its window: every
  // tap of "Exec Panel" ejected the exec into a browser tab.
  //
  // Env-driven rather than a literal because basePath is baked in at BUILD
  // time and localhost still wants a root-mounted console. `undefined` rather
  // than '' when unset, so an unset build resolves to exactly Next's default.

  // flag on 14; it is default-on from 15, and leaving the flag set now only
  // earns an "unrecognised experimental option" warning.
  // THE CLIENT ROUTER CACHE, which Next 15 turns off for dynamic routes.
  //
  // next/dist/server/config-shared.js defaults staleTimes to
  // `{ dynamic: 0, static: 300 }`. Every page in this app is force-dynamic, so
  // dynamic: 0 meant the in-memory router cache held a visited page for zero
  // seconds and switching tab -> other tab -> back re-ran the FULL server render
  // both ways, for data that had not changed. Next 14 defaulted this to 30s, so
  // the console silently got slower to navigate at the 15 upgrade rather than at
  // any change of ours.
  //
  // SAFE HERE BECAUSE MUTATIONS ALREADY INVALIDATE: 160 revalidatePath() calls
  // across 51 files plus 98 router.refresh() calls. Those drop the client cache,
  // so this window only ever applies to passive navigation between tabs — never
  // to a page you just wrote to. 30s is deliberately short for that reason: it
  // is long enough to cover flicking between sections while working, short
  // enough that a figure changed by somebody ELSE cannot sit wrong for long.
  //
  // NOT accompanied by prefetch={true} on the nav links, on purpose. Prefetch on
  // a dynamic route only warms the nearest loading.tsx (the skeleton) unless
  // forced, and forcing it fires a full server render PER LINK. Render is
  // single-threaded and is this app's measured bottleneck, so blanket prefetch
  // would multiply load on exactly the constrained resource.
