/**
 * Credential Manager, which on API 33 and below goes through Play services
 * (credentials-play-services-auth) and on 34 and up through the platform.
 * [activityContext] must be an Activity: the account sheet is shown over it.
 * The manager is made on first use, so a member who never taps the passkey
 * button never loads it.
 *
 * Only a real cancel is silent. A DOM NotAllowedError is NOT treated as one:
 * a broken assetlinks file or an RP ID mismatch surfaces as exactly that, and
 * reading it as a cancel would make a misconfigured server look like a member
 * who changed their mind (the website's passkey client learned the same).
 * Nothing here is logged: the request and the response are both sensitive.
