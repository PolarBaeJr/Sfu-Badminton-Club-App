 * The web login's check, shared by every way in (email code, passkey):
 * players_self is scoped to the caller, so no row and no error means an
 * account that never finished signing up. That session is ended on this
 * device and never kept. A read error fails OPEN, as it does on the web.
 * The session is published only after the check, so no screen ever sees an
 * unfinished account signed in. False means unfinished (already logged out).
