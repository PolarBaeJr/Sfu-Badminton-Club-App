-- ============================================================
-- 00285: DELETION REACHES THE FORM IMPORT
--
-- 00283 and 00284 brought Google Form registrations in, and with them five
-- places a person's TYPED name and email can sit. Nothing in the account
-- deletion path knew about any of them. This file is the half of the purge
-- they were missing.
--
-- WHAT SURVIVED A DELETION BEFORE THIS FILE.
--   The purge (supabase/functions/_shared/anonymize.ts, run by both
--   purge-deleted-accounts and purge-inactive-accounts) rewrites the players
--   row and deletes a fixed list of player_id tables. A member's own form rows
--   are FK-only by CHECK (registration_imports_member_has_no_email,
--   registration_import_entries_member_or_external), so those were fine. What
--   was not fine is everything the form stored about the person BEFORE they
--   were a member, or stored under their address by somebody else, because
--   those rows carry no player id at all and are linked to them only by the
--   email:
--
--     registration_imports.submitter_name / submitter_email
--         their own response, sent while the address matched no member
--     registration_import_entries.external_name / external_email
--         the same, per event
--     registration_import_entries.partner_name / partner_email
--         another person's response naming them as partner, by an address
--         that matched no member at the time
--     club_event_external_signups.full_name / email
--         their place in a club event as a guest (00284)
--     guest_waiver_invites.email
--         the waiver mail owed to them as a guest
--     club_fees.manual_name / manual_email
--         a named fee that claim_named_fees_for_player could NOT move onto
--         their account (they already owed one for that season, tournament
--         or event), so it stayed named
--     tournament_pairs.external1_name / external2_name / pair_name
--         the external team the import entered, in their typed name
--
--   And in audit_logs, keyed by the player id rather than by any address:
--
--     manual_fee_claimed   old_value.manual_name, the typed name of every
--                          named fee the claim trigger moved onto them
--                          (00252 for dues, 00283 and 00284 for the rest)
--     manual_fee_attached  old_value.named_fee, a whole named fee row with
--                          manual_name and manual_email, written by the
--                          console when an exec attached one to them
--     manual_fee_added     new_value.manual_name / manual_email, when the
--                          console created a named fee under their address
--
--   scrub_deleted_identity (00155) reaches audit_logs only for
--   target_type = 'player', and these are all target_type = 'club_fee'.
--
-- THE "DELINKED" COLUMNS WERE NEVER DELINKED. submitter_player_id,
-- entrant_id, requested_partner_id, undone_by and created_by are declared
-- ON DELETE SET NULL. The purge anonymises by UPDATE and never deletes a
-- players row, so not one of those actions has ever fired for a deletion
-- (the same trap _shared/anonymize.ts records for feedback_reports). They are
-- left as they are, on purpose: they now point at a row called Deleted
-- Player, which is how matches, attendance and fees already read, and an
-- entry with no entrant at all would read in the console as a guest.
--
-- HOW. One trigger on players, the shape 00282 already uses for predictions:
-- AFTER UPDATE OF email, when the new address is the purge's marker
-- `deleted+<id>@deleted.invalid`. It is the only moment the real address is
-- still known (OLD.email); a minute later, scrub_deleted_identity's predicate
-- would find the member but could no longer say which typed rows were theirs.
-- Being a trigger on the anonymising UPDATE, it runs for both purge jobs and
-- for any hand-run anonymisation, and nothing in the edge functions changes:
-- the deployed copies of anonymize.ts and the purge jobs need no edit.
--
-- WHICH ADDRESSES. OLD.email, plus every address an external entry was made
-- under whose fee the claim later moved onto the member. That second set is
-- what still finds the guest rows of a member who joined with the address
-- they had entered under and later changed their account email, and of a
-- member purged before this file existed, whose OLD.email is gone.
--
-- WHAT EACH ROW BECOMES. Rows are kept; only the identity goes.
--   * Nullable columns are nulled: registration_imports.submitter_*,
--     registration_import_entries.external_* and partner_*, and a dues fee's
--     manual_email.
--   * Columns a CHECK requires are given placeholders: 'Deleted Player' for a
--     name, `deleted+<row id>@deleted.invalid` for an address. The ROW id,
--     not the player id, so every per-email unique key stays unique and no
--     placeholder ever equals a players.email.
--   * An unsent guest waiver invite is also CANCELLED. claim_guest_waiver_
--     invites does not skip @deleted.invalid, and an invite left live would be
--     mailed to a dead address, which costs the sending domain reputation.
--   * A dues fee whose 'Deleted Player' name is already taken in that season
--     (club_fees_manual_name_season_key) gets the row id's first eight
--     characters after it.
--   * An external pair keeps its result; the slot that was the deleted
--     person becomes 'Deleted Player' ('Deleted Player 2' when the other slot
--     already reads that, for tournament_pairs_member_or_external), and the
--     pair name is rebuilt only when it is the default "A / B".
--   * audit_logs keep every row, action, actor, time and target; the name
--     and email keys come out, as 00155 does for player rows.
--
-- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY LEFT.
--   * guest_waiver_signings. The privacy policy (section 6) keeps a guest's
--     signed waiver permanently as evidence and never joins it to an account.
--   * A partner_name typed with NO address, or with an address that is not
--     the member's. A name alone does not identify anyone, and erasing every
--     "Alex" on a guess would erase other people's records.
--   * A partner's details on the member's OWN entries. Those are the
--     partner's data, kept as the policy keeps external entrants'.
--   * Entry statuses. An entry still awaiting the deleted member is left for
--     an exec to undo; the confirmation mail already skips deleted addresses.
--
-- THE TRIGGER MUST NOT FAIL. It runs inside the anonymising UPDATE, after the
-- auth user is gone. Every value it writes is chosen against the CHECKs and
-- unique indexes on its column (listed beside each statement), so a raise
-- here would be a bug, not a data condition. It is not wrapped in a WARNING:
-- if it ever did raise, the whole UPDATE rolls back and the member stays
-- eligible, so the next night retries rather than half-erasing them.
