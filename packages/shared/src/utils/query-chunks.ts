// Splitting an `.in(column, ids)` filter so the request line stays under the
// proxy's limit.
//
// PostgREST takes `.in()` as a QUERY-STRING parameter — `?id=in.(uuid,uuid,…)`
// — so the filter's size is the URL's size, and a `select` is a GET with no
// body to move it into. Kong 3.9.1 sits in front of PostgREST and refuses a
// request line over 8,192 bytes with `414 Request-URI Too Large`.
//
// MEASURED on the production request path (Cloudflare → proxy-manager → Kong →
// PostgREST), from inside the running admin container, against the same select
// list the push path uses:
//
//     215 ids → 8,047 B → reached PostgREST
//     220 ids → 8,232 B → 414
//     500 ids → 18,592 B → 520 (Cloudflare gives up before Kong answers)
//
// So the club's push stops working entirely somewhere between 215 and 220
// members — on roster size alone, with no user-visible error, because the
// caller of the failed read fails closed and withholds push from everybody
// while the in-app bell keeps working.
//
// The constants below encode that constraint rather than a number that happens
// to work today, so the chunk size moves if the limit or the id format does.

 * line (IN_CHUNK_SIZE = 110). For a read that returns ONE ROW PER ID — the
 * players lookups it was written for — bounding the ids also bounds the rows,
 * so one limit covers both. For a ONE-TO-MANY read it does not: 110 session ids
 * against `session_attendance` is 110 × however many people turned up, which is
 * thousands of rows in a single request. Production sets `db-max-rows` to
 * 1,000, PostgREST truncates silently at that number, and the caller counts
 * whatever survived. The chunking makes the URL legal; the answer is still
 * wrong.
 *
 * That is the shape of the sessions bug: `/sessions` read the whole of
 * `session_attendance` to tally card counts, crossed 1,000 rows at about 25
 * sessions, and from then on quietly under-counted every night on the page.
 * Scoping the read to the sessions actually rendered narrows it but does not
 * close it — 25 sessions of 40 members is exactly 1,000 rows.
 *
 * So: page until a SHORT page comes back.
 *
 * PAGE_SIZE IS DELIBERATELY WELL UNDER db-max-rows, and that margin is the
 * whole mechanism. "Short page means done" is only sound while the server
 * cannot be the thing that shortened it. Ask for 1,000 against a 1,000 cap and
 * a truncated page is indistinguishable from a final one; ask for 2,000 and
 * EVERY page comes back at 1,000, reading as short, and the loop stops after
 * one — the original bug with extra steps. At 500 the cap can only bite if
 * somebody lowers db-max-rows below 500, which is why the number is named here
