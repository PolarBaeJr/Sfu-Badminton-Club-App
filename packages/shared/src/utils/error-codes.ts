// STABLE, DOCUMENTED ERROR CODES.
//
// A server error reaches the browser with its message withheld and only a
// `digest`. Next makes that digest a per-crash number, which tells an exec
// nothing and tells a developer only which log line to grep for. Errors raised
// through AppError (./app-error) instead carry `digest = "<CODE>.<ref>"`: the
// code says what kind of failure it was and stays the same forever, the ref is
// random per occurrence and is what to grep the server log for.
//
// THIS FILE HAS NO IMPORTS, on purpose. It is reached from the edge bundle
// (through expected-error.ts, which instrumentation.ts and the Sentry init files
// deep-import) and from client components, so it must not pull in the shared
// barrel, node:crypto or anything else. The registry also ships to the browser:
// nothing in `cause` may be sensitive.
//
// Codes are `AREA-NNN`. Ranges inside an area: 000 unknown, 1xx a load failed
// or a guard refused, 2xx a save or sign-in step failed, 3xx a data conflict,
// 4xx an expected row is missing, 5xx infrastructure, 6xx a database rule.
// NO AREA MAY START WITH "E": Next appends `@E<n>` to digests and reads the
// first `@` segment starting with E as its own error code.
//
// ERROR-CODES.md is generated from this file (see renderErrorCatalogue and the
// catalogue test). Never reuse a retired code for a different meaning.
