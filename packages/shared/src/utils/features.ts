// CLUB FEATURE SWITCHES: which optional member-facing features are running.
//
// One platform_settings row, key `features`, holding `<id>_enabled` booleans.
// No migration seeds it: an absent row or an absent field reads as the
// feature's default, so nothing changes until an admin flips a switch on
// /accounts. The first save inserts the row (see SEEDABLE_SETTINGS in the
// admin's actions/settings.ts).
//
// ON BY DEFAULT, unless the entry says `defaultEnabled: false`. A default-on
// feature is switched off only by a literal `false`; a default-off one is
// switched on only by a literal `true`. So every doubt resolves to the default.
//
// A FAILED READ IS ALSO THE DEFAULT. Hiding a feature is not a safety
// property, and a settings blip must not make a live tournament vanish
// mid-event. A default-off feature stays off, because it is off until somebody
// has decided otherwise (guest_waivers waits on a privacy policy that covers
// guests).
//
// THIS REGISTRY DRIVES EVERYTHING ELSE: the player nav, the admin nav, the
// redirect gate on the player routes, the refusal in the player actions and
// the switches on the settings form. Adding a feature is one entry here plus
// a gate on its routes; feature-registry.test.ts in the player app checks that
// every route named below exists and that no protected route is switchable.
//
// EVERY ENTRY ALSO MINTS A CAPABILITY, `page.access.<id>`, derived in
// ./access-level.ts: the key that lets one person into the feature while it is
// off. So a new entry also needs the string added to the vocabulary CHECKs in
// a migration, and capability-storage.test.ts fails until it is.
//
// Deliberately dependency-free, so the nav modules and a client component can
// import it deeply without pulling the shared barrel.
//
// NEVER SWITCHABLE: the feed and home page, settings, legal, sign-in,
// onboarding, account linking, notifications, email and unsubscribe, the exec
// panel and feedback. Account, legal and safety paths must always work.
