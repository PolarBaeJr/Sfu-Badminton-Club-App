// is published and players have already been told who they play.
//

// round-robin fixtures at 'pool_generated', and from that moment every word
// above is true of it — people have been told who they play and when. Left off
// this list, a member could withdraw out of a running pool through the player
// app and the fixtures would silently keep their name in them. The two statuses
// appear on no other format, so nothing else changes meaning.

// is_bye` — the progress figure, which counts a bye because a bye is a slot
// that no longer needs a court. Gating the redraw on that number would have

// ------------------------------------------------------------
//
// isPlayedMatch is right for what it says: has this match been decided by
// something that happened. Regenerating a draw asks a DIFFERENT question —
// would deleting every match in this phase take something with it that cannot
// be got back — and the two answers differ in exactly two places. Both cost the
// club something real, so they are named here rather than folded into
// isPlayedMatch, whose meaning is depended on elsewhere.
//
// 1. A MATCH ON COURT. 'live' is not in RESULT_MATCH_STATUSES and should not be:
//    a live match genuinely has no result and no Elo. But it has PEOPLE ON IT.
//    Regenerating replaces the board while three rallies are in progress and
//    the desk is told nothing. This needs no race at all — just an exec who
//    does not know 'live' is not counted.
//
// 2. AN APPLIED RATING THAT WAS NEVER REVERSED. elo_snapshot is the only record
//    of the deltas a rated match put on the ladder (00078); delete the row and
//    reverse_tournament_match_rating has nothing to read and the ladder is
//    permanently wrong. Normally a rated match is also `completed`, so (1)
//    would catch it — but rows in exactly that shape EXIST ON PRODUCTION, left
//    by a void racing a result entry back when voidMatchImpl wrote status on
//    the id alone. That race is closed now (the write is conditional on the
//    status, a null snapshot and the occupants), so no NEW row can reach this
//    shape — but the old ones are still there and this guard is the only thing
//    standing between them and a redraw. It stays. A properly voided match has
//    had its snapshot nulled by the reversal, so it does NOT count here and
//    void-then-redraw still works.
//
// THE SERVER IS THE AUTHORITY, NOT THIS. These counts grey the button and say
// why; migration 00144's delete_phase_matches re-checks the same three
// conditions on the rows it actually deleted, inside one statement, and rolls
// the delete back. This is the courtesy; that is the guarantee.
