// TWO PUBLIC PAGES MUST NOT CALL THE SAME PERSON TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.
//
// /leaderboard and /exec are both reachable signed out, and each takes its
// names from its own SECURITY DEFINER function. 00092 retired the free-text
// nickname and moved get_leaderboard()'s `name` from COALESCE(display_name,
// full_name) to full_name — a change it called out as visible on a public page
// — and did not touch get_executives(), which went on returning the nickname.
// So an officer was "Kiera Watanabe" on the ladder and "kiera" on the exec
// page for as long as that lasted. 00096 is the other half.
//
// The failure was not that either function was wrong on its own. It was that
// nothing said the two had to agree, so a migration could move one. This is
// that statement, and it is deliberately made against the LAST definition of
// each function in the whole directory rather than against a named file: a
// migration is applied by piping the file into psql, so the last CREATE wins,
// and pinning a file number would go stale the first time either is redefined.
//
// Reading the SQL as text is crude, and it is the same crudeness
// capability-storage.test.ts settles for and for the same reason: anything
// cleverer would be a second place the rule is written down.
