 * Every notification email goes through here.
 *
 * Two gates before anything is handed to the provider:
 *   1. the address is on email_suppressions (hard bounce, complaint, or a
 *      one-click unsubscribe-from-all);
 *   2. the member turned this category's email off.
 *
 * A blocked send is NOT an error. `sendEmail` throws by design so that genuine
 * delivery failures stay visible, and every call site logs what it catches — so
 * throwing here would file "this person unsubscribed" as a delivery incident in
 * Sentry. It returns an outcome instead.
 *
 * Sign-in codes do NOT come through here: those are issued by GoTrue, and a
 * member must always be able to get into their account.
 *
 * `transactional` skips gate 2 only. It is for the one-off mail that IS the
 * event rather than a subscription to it — currently just "your account has
 * been approved", which a brand-new member has to receive to know the app is
 * open to them. Since 00058 made preferences opt-in, a new member's blob is
 * empty, so without this that email would never arrive and the account would
 * look stuck at "pending" forever. Gate 1 (suppressions, bounces, complaints,
 * unsubscribe-from-all) still applies — nothing bypasses that.
