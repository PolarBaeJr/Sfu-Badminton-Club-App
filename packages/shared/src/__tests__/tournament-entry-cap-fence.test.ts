/**
 * THE CROSS-EVENT ENTRY CAP, AND WHO IS ALLOWED TO WRITE THE FIELD WITHOUT IT.
 *
 * `tournaments.max_events_per_player` bounds how many of one tournament's
 * events a single member may be entered in. Counting it is a CROSS-EVENT
 * question, so the event's advisory key does not serialise it: two entries into
 * two DIFFERENT events of the same tournament take two different keys and both
 * read the same pre-write count. 00201 closed that by making every counter also
 * take the tournament row `FOR UPDATE` — one row, one queue, regardless of
 * which event each entry is for.
 *
 * That fix is a discipline, not a constraint, and nothing in the schema keeps
 * it. A fourth function that counts the cap without the row lock would reopen
 * the race exactly as it stood before 00201, and would read as correct on
 * review because the advisory lock IS there. This test is the thing that
 * notices.
 *
 * IT IS DELIBERATELY TWO SEPARATE ASSERTIONS, because "takes the tournament
 * lock" is NOT a property of field writers in general:
 *
 *   1. Every function that READS max_events_per_player must take both locks,
 *      IN ORDER, with the count on the far side of the row lock. 3/3 today, no
 *      exemptions. This is the invariant with teeth.
 *
 *   2. The set of functions that INSERT an entrant is a closed, classified
 *      list. Most members of it legitimately never read the cap, so asserting
 *      a lock on them would be an assertion with more exemptions than
 *      subjects. A census forces the next writer to be classified instead.
 *
 * ORDER IS ASSERTED, NOT JUST PRESENCE — codex round 28. The first version of
 * this file asked only whether both lock statements appeared somewhere in the
 * body, which a regression that moved the count ABOVE the row lock walks
 * straight through: both statements are still there, the count is still
 * unserialised, and the test stays green. That is the same shape as the
 * `recomputeEventStandings` defect (a gate at the bottom of a function passes
 * any "A is present and so is B" check), and it is the whole failure this file
 * exists to catch.
 *
 * Source-level, over the migrations, so it runs in CI with no database — the
 * same reason field-write-fence.test.ts parses application code rather than
 * asking Postgres.
