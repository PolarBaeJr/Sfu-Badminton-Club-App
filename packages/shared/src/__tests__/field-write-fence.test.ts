// EVERY WRITE TO THE EVENT FIELD GOES THROUGH A FENCED RPC, OR IT IS NOT FENCED.
//
// Migration 00201 put every database function that writes tournament_participants
// or tournament_pairs behind ONE advisory key. That closed nothing on its own,
// because the apps were also writing those tables directly over PostgREST — nine
// call sites taking no lock of any kind, which is why four rounds of review kept
// finding the same class of race in functions that were individually correct.
//
// THIS TEST EXISTS BECAUSE A GREP DID NOT FIND THEM ALL. The worst of the nine
// wrote through a VARIABLE table name:
//
//   const table = isPair ? 'tournament_pairs' : 'tournament_participants';
//   await adminClient.from(table).update({ status })
//
// No search for either table name matches that line, so it survived four
// reviews — and a tenth site in results.ts survived the per-file sweep that
// found the other nine. A census that resolves the variable is the only shape
// that catches them, so that is what this does, and it is the application-side
// half of the pg_proc census in 00201's verification block.
//
// THE RULE
//   - No DELETE or INSERT on a field table from application code. Membership is
//     remove_field_entry's and the entry RPCs' business.
//   - No UPDATE that writes `status`. That is set_field_entry_status,
//     mark_field_entries_no_show, or one of the older fenced RPCs.
//   - UPDATEs that write only ordering or scoring columns are allowed and are
//     listed below. They do not add, remove, or move anybody in or out of the
//     field, which is what the fence protects; they are the application-side
//     counterpart of 00201's allowlist of rating-only database functions.
//
// A NEW write to these tables fails this test until somebody classifies it.
// That is the point: the classification is the review.

/**
 * Columns an application write may set on a field table without a fence, and
 * the ONLY files allowed to set them.
 *
 * Ordering and scoring only. None of these moves anybody in or out of the
 * field, which is what the fence protects — but "the column is harmless" was
 * too weak a rule and 00209 is why. seeding.ts wrote seed_number and
 * group_number from six unfenced call sites, four of them through a runtime
 * `table` variable, and passed this test on the strength of the column names
 * alone. Seeds are the draw's INPUT: a seed landing between the generator
 * building a bracket and publish_event_draw accepting it publishes a bracket
 * whose seeding no longer matches the rows. Those six now go through
 * set_field_entry_seed / auto_seed_field_by_rating / clear_field_seeds /
 * set_field_groups / set_field_entry_group, which take the field key.
 *
 * So the allowance is per FILE as well as per column, and each entry has to
 * say what makes that particular site safe:
 *
 *   brackets.ts   — seed_number and group_number, written INSIDE a generation
 *                   that ends in publish_event_draw. That publication is
 *                   fenced, re-reads the field under the lock, and refuses on
 *                   a mismatched entrant set or a moved group digest (00202),
 *                   so these writes are checked by the step that consumes
 *                   them. They are not free-standing edits the way seeding.ts's
 *                   were.
 *   finalize.ts   — final_position and points, written from an event that is
 *                   already over. Nothing downstream draws from them, and the
 *                   flip to completed is itself fenced (00209).
 *
 * A write of one of these columns from ANY OTHER file fails, because the
 * reasoning above is about those two flows and does not transfer.

/**
 * KNOWN GAPS in this census, named by codex round 11 and left in deliberately.
 * Codex found no current illegal application write through any of them; they
 * are blind spots in a regression guard, not live holes. Recorded here rather
 * than closed because closing them properly means parsing TypeScript, and an
 * AST pass is a bigger and more fragile thing than what it would protect.
 *
 *   1. A VARIABLE update payload defeats it. `.update(patch)` yields no
 *      object literal, objectKeys() returns [], and an empty column list
 *      satisfies every downstream assertion silently — it fails OPEN, not
 *      closed. A new fenced write must therefore pass its columns inline.
 *   2. Indirect aliases are only partly resolved. tableAliases() below matches
 *      a single-quoted table name in the SAME file on the SAME assignment; a
 *      name reaching `.from()` through an import, an object property, or a
 *      template string is invisible.
 *   3. The scan covers apps/ only. A field write added outside apps/ would not
 *      be seen at all.
 *
 * If you add a field-table write, the guard protects you only if it is a
 * literal `.from('...')` with a literal object payload, inside apps/.
