# Error codes

Generated from `packages/shared/src/utils/error-codes.ts`. Do not edit by hand: change the
registry and regenerate with `npm test -w @badminton/shared -- -u`.

An error screen or toast shows a code like `DB-101.k3x9q2ab`. The part before the dot is the
code below and never changes meaning. The part after it is a random reference for that one
occurrence, and it is what to search the server log for.

Ranges inside an area: 000 unknown, 1xx a load failed or a guard refused, 2xx a save or sign-in
step failed, 3xx a data conflict, 4xx an expected row is missing, 5xx infrastructure, 6xx a
database rule. A reference made only of digits (`GEN-000.2299239490`) came from an error that
had no code of its own, and the digits are the digest Next printed in the log.

## AUTH: Sign-in and access

| Code | Title | What the user sees | Likely cause |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AUTH-000` | Sign-in problem | Something went wrong while checking who you are. Sign in again and retry. | An auth failure that matched no more specific code. |

| `AUTH-102` | Passkey check needed | Confirm with your passkey, then try again. | The console passkey step-up gate refused: this session has not verified a passkey. |
| `AUTH-103` | Passkey status unknown | We could not confirm your passkey setup. Try again in a moment. | The passkey enrolment lookup failed, so the step-up gate failed closed. |
| `AUTH-104` | Not allowed | Your role does not allow this. | The console capability check refused this role for the page or action. |

Start again from the sign-in page. | The OAuth or code exchange failed: bad_oauth_state, bad_oauth_callback, flow_state_expired, flow_state_not_found, bad_code_verifier, or the callback redirected with error=auth_failed. |
| `AUTH-207` | Sign-in blocked | This account cannot sign in. Contact an exec. | The auth server refused a banned user (user_banned). |
| `AUTH-208` | Passkey sign-in failed | Signing in with your passkey did not work. Try again, or use an email code. | The passkey ceremony was cancelled or its server-side verification failed. |

| `DB-301` | Already exists | That already exists. | Postgres 23505: a unique constraint refused a duplicate. |

## Finding it in the logs

Search for the reference, not the code: the code groups many occurrences, the reference
names one. The app may run as several instances, so search the server logs of every running
admin or player instance, not just one.

A page or thrown action logs its digest through Next. A server action that returns its error
as a value (runAction) is not logged by Next, so runAction logs coded failures itself as
`[action] <CODE.ref>`. Sentry events carry the same values as the `error_code` and `error_ref`
tags.
